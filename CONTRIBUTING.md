## Get Started Quickly

### I'm Stuck with a Quick Question!

Sorry, we do not have documentation with F.A.Q. yet. Please visit us on Discord instead! Our Github repo is not the place for support questions. Find the link in [README.md - contact](README.md#contact).

### FDM Monster and Packages

FDM Monster currently consists of two active repositories:

- [FDM Monster](https://github.com/fdm-monster/fdm-monster): the server and client packed together as one
- [FDM Connector](https://github.com/fdm-monster/fdm-connector): the OctoPrint plugin ‚ö†Ô∏è(not in use)

### FDM Monster Design Decisions

#### Server design

- **FDM Monster server** was chosen to be a NodeJS server. The backend is currently structured as a REST API. It might be surprising that we use `awilix` as Inversion-of-Control implementation, but if you study the resulting architecture, it will show its fresh and quick-to-develop benefits rapidly.
- **FDM Monster server** runs using MongoDB as a database and Mongoose as ORM.
- **FDM Monster server** caches data in-memory using a self-written store/cache system between the database (no redis!).
- **FDM Monster server** API is built up using `awilix-express` and uses `node-input-validation` as API validation.
- **FDM Monster server** is equipped with a task scheduler (ToadScheduler) which gives the capability to run workloads in the background.

#### Client design

- Its web client is written using Typescript and Vue2.
- We intend to switch to Vue3 once Vuetify3 is released and stable.
- Vuetify is currently the package for Material UI and components.
- We use vue-class-component for maintaining class Vue components.
- Vuex serves as store and state management.
