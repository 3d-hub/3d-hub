The ADC pull-ups are now periodically reset to prevent false reads. Everything happens automatically in the background, there is no need for user intervention.\r\n\r\n### Norwegian language (community translation)\r\nThe list of languages translated by the active Prusa community members grows longer with the addition of **Norwegian** :norway:. We would like to thank members @pkg2000 and @trondkla who contributed their translations to this firmware release.\r\n\r\nYou can also contribute and expand the translation team. Read the [article about translations at our Help site](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/community-translations_282960) to learn **how to join.**\r\n\r\n### URL updated to [help.prusa3d.com](https://help.prusa3d.com)\r\nIn this release, the developers have replaced the link to the site “howto.prusa3d.com,” which was displayed in the printer's Support menu, with a new link pointing to “help.prusa3d.com.” Here you can find articles explaining how to set up the printer, describing firmware features, troubleshooting, maintenance and many more.\r\n\r\n### Feedback from the Prusa community\r\nWe greatly appreciate the feedback and help from the Prusa community we get with each firmware release. You can join us on the [forum.prusa3d.com](https://forum.prusa3d.com), where we discuss new features and bugfixes, and share your thoughts.\r\n",

Compared to the previous release candidate, there is one new community-translated language (Swedish) and the developers have done few fixes and improvements.\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank Prusa community members @AttilaSVK, @Painkiller56, @Hauzman, @Prime1910, @PRPA041, @ingbrzy, @shatter136, @pkg2000 who contributed to this firmware release.\r\n\r\n### New community translations \r\nDue to multiple firmware optimizations, the developers were able to free up space and the first community language (Dutch) was added in the release [3.10.0](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/releases/tag/v3.10.0). For this release we are further extending the list of languages:\r\n\r\n- Hungarian by @AttilaSVK and @Hauzman\r\n- Romanian by @leptun and @Hauzman\r\n- Croatian by @Prime1910 and @PRPA041\r\n- Slovak by @ingbrzy and @shatter136\r\n- Swedish by @Painkiller56 and @pkg2000\r\n\r\n![Wizard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/162232468-07c10a4e-f223-4aed-b50c-95ccbbba627b.gif)\r\n\r\nWe welcome everyone to join us and localize the printer to their native language. The translation procedure is designed to be easy and only basic computer skills are required. In case you would like to translate and maintain the translations, [please visit this article ](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/community-translation_282960) describing community translations.\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions for the community translations please open a [community GitHub issue](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/issues/new?assignees=&labels=community_made&template=community.md&title=%5BCommunity+made%5D+%3CEnter+comprehensive+title%3E) and don’t forget to mention the language, the message/translation and if you know the maintainer also tag her/him with GitHub username. You can find the status and maintainers of community languages [here](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/blob/MK3/lang/Community_made_translations.md). The community members are responsible to follow up your issues and prepare changes if needed for the next release.\r\n\r\nOriginal Prusa MK2.5 and MK2.5S users will find the firmware in the provided zip files.\r\n- English + Romanian end with `..._en-ro.hex`\r\n- English + Hungarian end with `..._en-hu.hex`\r\n- English + Croatian end with `..._en-hr.hex`\r\n- English + Slovak end with `..._en_sk.hex`\r\n- English + Swedish end with `..._en_sv.hex`\r\n\r\n*Disclaimer: Please note that community translations are made by the active community members and aren't further verified by Prusa Research, therefore some parts might be translated differently than originally intended.*\r\n\r\n### Added LCD support for `äöüß` and `μ`\r\nThe German translation got an update and now shows messages with an `äöüß` instead of `ä` -> `ae` , `ö` -> `oe`, `ü` -> `ue` and `ß` -> `ss`. The only limitation is, that we don’t have uppercase `ÄÖÜ` so words and at the beginning of a sentence it stays in lowercase `äöü`. We believe that even with only lower case `äöü` words and sentences read better than before.\r\n\r\nIn Swedish we also added the support for `äÄöÖ` as in German above but characters with diacritics `åÅ` are replaced without the diacritics as `aA`.\r\n\r\n### SN check fixed\r\nIn firmware 3.10.1, we have added a motherboard serial number check, a function for future projects. If you have a genuine Original Prusa 3D printer, this does not affect the functionality of your machine in any way. However, in case you run into issues with the serial number check, please contact our tech support. In case you have purchased a non-genuine board this should be now fixed.\r\n\r\n### Changes to on-screen messages\r\nWe have improved and consolidated a few messages displayed on the screen which saved quite a bit of resources we can use for other features but also keeps the wording more consistent.\r\n- Word `Choose` has been replaced by `Select`\r\n- We have unified fan naming to: `Extruder` and `Print` fan. `Nozzle` fan has been removed.\r\n- Renamed `Temp. cal` to `PINDA cal.` as this menu/feature might be misunderstood. The sole purpose of this feature is to calibrate the temperature drift of the PINDAv2 sensor. Note that SuperPINDA doesn’t need any `PINDA cal.` as it is temperature-independent. \r\n\r\nResources saved:\r\n|Printer|bytes flash|bytes mem|\r\n|---------|--------------|---------------| \r\n|MK3S | -300         | -5             |\r\n|MK3   | -510         | -5             |\r\n|MK25S| -900        | -5            |\r\n\r\n### Known issue (LCD glitches)\r\nSome printers might experience LCD glitches, or random characters displayed during XYZ calibration. This has been discovered and reproduced recently and the affected printers are mostly MK2.5 and MK2.5S. Based on our observations for the MK3 family of printers this issue is rare.\r\n\r\nThe developers have identified the issue and are working on a solution. We are sorry for the inconvenience.",

We would like to thank Prusa community members @AttilaSVK, @Painkiller56, @Hauzman, @Prime1910, @PRPA041, @ingbrzy and @shatter136 who contributed to this firmware release.\r\n\r\n### New community translations \r\nDue to multiple firmware optimizations, the developers were able to free up space and the first community language (Dutch) was added in the release [3.10.0](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/releases/tag/v3.10.0). For this release we are further extending the list of languages:\r\n\r\n- Hungarian by @AttilaSVK and @Hauzman\r\n- Romanian by @leptun and @Hauzman\r\n- Croatian by @Prime1910 and @PRPA041\r\n- Slovak by @ingbrzy and @shatter136\r\n\r\nWe welcome everyone to join us and localise the printer to their native language. The translation procedure is designed to be easy and only basic computer skills are required. In case you would like to translate and maintain the translations, [please visit this article ](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/community-translation_282960) describing community translations.\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestion to the community translations please open a [community GitHub issue](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/issues/new?assignees=&labels=community_made&template=community.md&title=%5BCommunity+made%5D+%3CEnter+comprehensive+title%3E) and don’t forget to mention the language, the message/translation and if you know the maintainer also tag her/him with GitHub username. You can find the status and maintainers of community languages [here](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/blob/MK3/lang/Community_made_translations.md). The community members are responsible to follow up your issues and prepare changes if needed for the next release.\r\n\r\nOriginal Prusa MK2.5 and MK2.5S users will find the firmware in the provided zip files:\r\n- English + Romanian end with `..._en-ro.hex`\r\n- English + Hungarian end with `..._en-hu.hex`\r\n- English + Croatian end with `..._en-hr.hex`\r\n- English + Slovak end with `..._en_sk.hex`\r\n\r\n*Disclaimer: Please note that community translations are made by the active community members and aren't further verified by Prusa Research, therefore some parts might be translated differently than originally intended.*\r\n\r\n### Added LCD support for `äöüß` and `μ`\r\nThe German translation got an update and now shows messages with an `äöüß` instead of `ä` -> `ae` , `ö` -> `oe`, `ü` -> `ue` and `ß` -> `ss`. The only limitation is, that we don’t have uppercase `ÄÖÜ` so words and at the beginning of a sentence it stays in lowercase `äöü`. We believe that even with only lower case `äöü` words and sentences read better than before.\r\n\r\n### Known issues\r\nIn the firmware [3.10.1](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/releases/tag/v3.10.1) we have added a motherboard serial number check, a function for future projects. If you have a genuine Original Prusa 3D printer, this does not affect the functionality of your machine in any way. In case you run into issues with the serial number check, please contact our tech support. In case you have purchased a non-genuine board, please be patient or downgrade the firmware - a fix is currently being tested and we plan to include it in the next release.",

These release notes also include information provided in the previous release RC1.\r\n\r\nBefore we describe all the new features, improvements and changes, we would like to thank the entire Prusa community members for their feedback - especially @gudnimg and @Panayiotis-git who helped us test and debug this firmware release. Your input is very much appreciated!\r\n\r\n### New debugging functions & crash analysis tools\r\nThe \"Dump memory\" feature is a very important new debugging support tool. It allows you to store the RAM content into the xFlash memory for further issue/bug analysis, just like we have in the Buddy firmware for the MINI+. This procedure has proven vital for identifying the rare bug of “static memory overwritten”.\r\n\r\n#### MK3, MK3S and MK3S+\r\nThis feature is now accessible from the printer’s Display menu Support-> Dump memory, which is the last command within the Support menu.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img width=\"700\" alt=\"Memory dump MK3\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/125960719-6f0e124f-78f4-47bb-9d93-cf00f4c9cb89.jpg\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nThe dump command is also available during an active print, which allows the user to execute an actual Memory \"Snapshot\" during a critical status or misbehavior of the printer. You will find it under LCD Menu -> Support -> Dump memory display menu. Please note that the snapshot takes some time to finish, therefore we advise not to use this feature if you are not experiencing any problems - i.e. the printer will stop for a while to dump the memory.\r\n\r\nAlso, to allow for simpler usage of this function, we put it at the end of the support menu for now. If it was hidden somewhere deep, a user experiencing an issue may hot reach this option quickly.\r\n\r\nWhen you have connected a serial device like Pronterface or Octoprint, you can use the following commands via the serial link:\r\n\r\n- D20 - create memory dump on xFlash (same as LCD Menu -> Support -> Dump memory) \r\n- D21 - download/print the memory dump via the serial link. This is the only way to get the Dump from the printer. Warning: please be aware not to connect the serial link during print as it can restart the printer and break the recent printing job\r\n- D22 - clear the current memory dump in the printer\r\n\r\nThe crash dump to xFlash is active at any time, it is stored in xFlash and can be downloaded even after the system reboot until a new D22 command is sent to the printer.\r\n\r\n#### MK2.5, MK2.5S and MK2.5S+\r\nThe MK2.5 series does not contain the xFlash, so the situation is different. The dump cannot be stored but it can be sent down to a serial link. In order to get the memory dump from the printer, there must be a serial link connection available prior to any dump download. In default, the LCD Menu -> Support -> Dump to serial and crash dump are disabled after printer restart. To get the dump the following process has to be followed and serial commands used:\r\n\r\n1. Connect the serial link to Printer. As the serial link connection restarts the Printer, it has to be done before any further activity.\r\n2. Using the D23 command from the serial link enables the crash dump by setting the crash dump flag and activates the LCD Menu -> Support-> Dump to serial display menu.\r\n3. D23 R command disables the crash dump and removes the LCD Menu -> Support-> Dump to serial display menu.\r\n4. The command D23 E - sends the Dump down to the serial link immediately and resets the printer.\r\n5. Command D20, D21, D22 are ignored.\r\n6. The Dump to serial command should be available even during print and should be found again under LCD Menu -> Support-> Dump to serial display menu.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img width=\"700\" alt=\"Dump to serial\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/125960988-e21face8-963c-4d6f-a2ca-63e3eaeaa543.jpg\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nPlease note, that in this release the “Dump memory” function is currently not fully working on the MK2.5 series. After the memory Dump is successfully sent down to the serial link the printer is freezing during Booting and you can see the following or similar:\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img width=\"700\" alt=\"Dump to serial\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/125961123-8260ac6d-7f3f-4610-a079-5a1d821f3f3d.jpg\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nTo resolve the situation at the current firmware build, push the HW reset button below the knob and the printer will restart. We are working on a workaround, this feature should be fully functional in the future firmware release. Should you find any other issues, please let us know.\r\n\r\n### A rare memory bug debugged and fixed \r\nWe have noticed several issues with unpredictable and non-replicable behavior like preheat menu loop when the printer was powered on with already loaded filament. Unpredictability and non-replicability made the root cause identification very hard. Recently we believe we found the major root cause. Its explanation is rather technical, but there’s really no other way to describe it.\r\n\r\nThe bug was not directly in our firmware, but we believe we ran into a bug in the link-time code generation stage of GCC 4.9.2 (bundled with PF-build-env-1.0.6.*) with optimization for size. The generated code could then partially overwrite the stack, which obviously resulted in random behavior. A workaround was found to avoid this bug by not allowing some functions to get inlined, even when they were used at one spot only.\r\n\r\nWe believe this is the main reason behind issues #3147, #3151, #3175 and probably others. We have verified that the code generation issue was also present in 3.9.3 already and probably in older FW versions as well. We have been able to track the problem down to FW 3.8.0, it may have been there even longer.\r\n\r\nFor more detailed technical description see please: https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/3202\r\n\r\nHowever, since we haven't been able to reproduce ANY of those issues mentioned above in-house during our tests, we kindly ask the community for help. To help with tracing those malfunctions, you can use the debugging tool described at the very beginning of these release notes.\r\n\r\nPlease, report any of those potential issues you discover on [GitHub](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/issues) and attach the Crash Dump file.\r\n\r\n### Long-Press action fixed\r\nIn the previous releases, the LCD knob \"Long press\" action was monitored and executed within the temperature control loop Interrupt Service Routine (ISR). This operation could under some circumstances destroy the menu buffer and create the menu itself inconsistently.\r\n\r\nThis change improves the printer reaction when the user is applying the \"Long press\" action (move Z etc. ). The main change is that the jog wheel \"Long press\" execution part has been moved to the main program loop. The temperature control loop is now exclusively dedicated to its generic task - temperature control.\r\n\r\n### Move auto reporting out of the temperature ISR\r\nThis change is similar to the Long-Press action described above. The code running in the temperature Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) needs to be fully reentrant, which is hard to keep for other than Temperature control tasks.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the auto reporting (response to M155) is moved to the main processing loop. This can make the auto reporting slower or irregular but removes the reentrant restriction, which allows to use “printf_P” to serial port and to keep Temperature ISR only for temperature control.\r\n\r\nFor more information head to: https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/3180\r\n\r\n### Uint8_t used consistently for the block buffer's index\r\nWe have identified and fixed another potential problem in the planner’s block buffer. The index was sometimes computed as an int (2 bytes), sometimes as 1-byte uint8_t. On the AVR working with 2-byte integers, this is generally not an atomic operation, because it takes multiple instructions to perform. Since it has been possible, all indices of the block buffer are now referenced as 1-byte uint8_t.\r\n\r\n### Arduino boards definition updated\r\nThe developers have merged several pull requests from the community. These commits changed the logic for parts of the code that are dependent on the board version, moving that dependent information directly to the boards.txt file. This simplifies the board version-dependent actions to be done by the compiler and makes them more transparent. Other compilation optimization changes have been made as well. This will not change the printer functionality but the built code quality and bug tracking is improved. The board definition was updated to v1.0.4.\r\n\r\nFor more detailed information, see please links below:\r\n- https://github.com/prusa3d/Arduino_Boards/pull/8\r\n- https://github.com/prusa3d/Arduino_Boards/pull/10\r\n- https://github.com/prusa3d/Arduino_Boards/pull/11\r\n- https://github.com/prusa3d/Arduino_Boards/pull/12\r\n\r\n### Build script updated\r\nFor our community members, who besides printing also enjoy coding, we have updated our build script to version 2.0, which focuses on improving the [MK404](https://github.com/vintagepc/MK404) project, which is an MK3 printer family simulator. Adding this project to the PF-build.sh will enable users to compile the Prusa-Firmware and immediately start the simulator with the correct hex file and correct printer. \r\n\r\nThe credit for this great simulator goes to [VintagePC](https://github.com/vintagepc).\r\n\r\n### Algorithm for reading SN in EEPROM improved\r\nAnother significant improvement is a Serial Number (SN) reading algorithm change from the 32u2 communication chip. When reading the SN, the code is expected to start with the standard \"CZPX\" prefix used for all Prusa printers worldwide. Unsuccessful attempts are repeated until a valid SN is read.\r\n\r\n### Spanish translation fixed\r\nA tiny contribution from our community on improving wording in Spanish translation. Specifically for the text string: \"Was filament unload successful?\".\r\n\r\n### Firmware version parsing removed\r\nThis FW optimization has saved 936 bytes of Flash memory which is very important in the already critically occupied XFlash memory.\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n#### Temperature display glitch\r\nThis bug is related only to 3.10.1-RC, where after a manual filament update the printer might display the hotend temperature at the top row of the screen, even though the user was in a different part of the menu.\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank user [Panayiotis-git](https://github.com/Panayiotis-git) for reporting this issue and providing a suggestion for a fix. More information can be found in the following pull requests PR#3214 and PR#3303.\r\n\r\n#### Build error if TMC service code is enabled fixed\r\nIn case you are building your own firmware from the code with parameter TMC2130_SERVICE_CODES_M910_M918, then the build process resulted in an error. This bug was introduced recently to 3.10.1-RC.\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank user [gudnimg](https://github.com/gudnimg) for reporting this issue and providing a suggestion for a fix. More information can be found in the following pull requests PR#3285 and PR#3304. This fixes the issue #3284.\r\n\r\n#### Premature file list closure fixed\r\nIn certain scenarios, the folder/file list opened and closed immediately after the SD card was inserted, which required the user to reinsert the card again. This was happening due to a timeout and the current fix is making sure lcd_timeoutToStatus.start() is called in the specific case when the SD card is inserted into the printer after it was removed beforehand.\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank again user [gudnimg](https://github.com/gudnimg) for reporting this issue and providing a suggestion for a fix. More information can be found in the following pull requests PR#3269 and PR#3305.\r\n\r\n#### Occasional missing error message\r\nIn the initial release 3.10.1-RC1 our testing team was able to achieve a specific scenario (either Preheat error or Thermal runaway), when the printer correctly turned off the heating, but the error message was not displayed. The developers have found and fixed this issue.\r\n\r\n#### \"Preheating to load\" screen behavior fixed\r\nDuring the Load filament process, the printer was waiting for the preset temperature and displayed the \"Preheating to load\" message. When the user removed the SD card, the previous message was replaced by the message \"Card removed\" but the Preheating process still did not finish, so the lasting displayed message was not correct. Now after this and similar action the “Preheating to load\" message is redrawn again which is the correct Process status Message.\r\n\r\n#### Message on boot while inserting SD card fixed\r\nWhen the user inserted the SD card during the booting process, the \"Sorting files\" message was presented twice on the display later followed by the correct \"Print from SD menu\" message. The issue has been reported on GitHub issue #3135 and clearly reproduced.\r\nWe have fixed the SD card handling while booting scenario, which corrected the double \"Sorting files\" message. Now the system works correctly.\r\n\r\n",

The main motivation behind this effort was to catch very rare bugs exhibiting symptoms like memory corruption or a random mid-print crash.\r\n\r\n### New debugging functions & crash analysis tools\r\nThe \"Dump memory\" feature is a very important new debugging support tool. It allows you to store the RAM content into the xFlash memory for further issue/bug analysis, just like we have in the Buddy firmware for the MINI+. This procedure has proven vital for identifying the rare bug of “static memory overwritten”.\r\n\r\n#### MK3, MK3S and MK3S+\r\nThis feature is now accessible from the printer’s Display menu Support-> Dump memory, which is the last command within the Support menu.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img width=\"700\" alt=\"Memory dump MK3\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/125960719-6f0e124f-78f4-47bb-9d93-cf00f4c9cb89.jpg\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nThe dump command is also available during an active print, which allows the user to execute an actual Memory \"Snapshot\" during a critical status or misbehavior of the printer. You will find it under LCD Menu -> Support -> Dump memory display menu. Please note that the snapshot takes some time to finish, therefore we advise not to use this feature if you are not experiencing any problems - i.e. the printer will stop for a while to dump the memory.\r\n\r\nAlso, to allow for simpler usage of this function, we put it at the end of the support menu for now. If it was hidden somewhere deep, a user experiencing an issue may hot reach this option quickly.\r\n\r\nWhen you have connected a serial device like Pronterface or Octoprint, you can use the following commands via the serial link:\r\n\r\n- D20 - create memory dump on xFlash (same as LCD Menu -> Support -> Dump memory) \r\n- D21 - download/print the memory dump via the serial link. This is the only way to get the Dump from the printer. Warning: please be aware not to connect the serial link during print as it can restart the printer and break the recent printing job\r\n- D22 - clear the current memory dump in the printer\r\n\r\nThe crash dump to xFlash is active at any time, it is stored in xFlash and can be downloaded even after the system reboot until a new D22 command is sent to the printer.\r\n\r\n#### MK2.5, MK2.5S and MK2.5S+\r\nThe MK2.5 series does not contain the xFlash, so the situation is different. The dump cannot be stored but it can be sent down to a serial link. In order to get the memory dump from the printer, there must be a serial link connection available prior to any dump download. In default, the LCD Menu -> Support -> Dump to serial and crash dump are disabled after printer restart. To get the dump the following process has to be followed and serial commands used:\r\n\r\n1. Connect the serial link to Printer. As the serial link connection restarts the Printer, it has to be done before any further activity.\r\n2. Using the D23 command from the serial link enables the crash dump by setting the crash dump flag and activates the LCD Menu -> Support-> Dump to serial display menu.\r\n3. D23 R command disables the crash dump and removes the LCD Menu -> Support-> Dump to serial display menu.\r\n4. The command D23 E - sends the Dump down to the serial link immediately and resets the printer.\r\n5. Command D20, D21, D22 are ignored.\r\n6. The Dump to serial command should be available even during print and should be found again under LCD Menu -> Support-> Dump to serial display menu.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img width=\"700\" alt=\"Dump to serial\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/125960988-e21face8-963c-4d6f-a2ca-63e3eaeaa543.jpg\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nPlease note, that in this release the “Dump memory” function is currently not fully working on the MK2.5 series. After the memory Dump is successfully sent down to the serial link the printer is freezing during Booting and you can see the following or similar:\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img width=\"700\" alt=\"Dump to serial\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/125961123-8260ac6d-7f3f-4610-a079-5a1d821f3f3d.jpg\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nTo resolve the situation at the current firmware build, push the HW reset button below the knob and the printer will restart. We are working on a workaround, this feature should be fully functional in the future firmware release. Should you find any other issues, please let us know.\r\n\r\n### A rare memory bug debugged and fixed \r\nWe have noticed several issues with unpredictable and non-replicable behavior like preheat menu loop when the printer was powered on with already loaded filament. Unpredictability and non-replicability made the root cause identification very hard. Recently we believe we found the major root cause. Its explanation is rather technical, but there’s really no other way to describe it.\r\n\r\nThe bug was not directly in our firmware, but we believe we ran into a bug in the link-time code generation stage of GCC 4.9.2 (bundled with PF-build-env-1.0.6.*) with optimization for size. The generated code could then partially overwrite the stack, which obviously resulted in random behavior. A workaround was found to avoid this bug by not allowing some functions to get inlined, even when they were used at one spot only.\r\n\r\nWe believe this is the main reason behind issues #3147, #3151, #3175 and probably others. We have verified that the code generation issue was also present in 3.9.3 already and probably in older FW versions as well. We have been able to track the problem down to FW 3.8.0, it may have been there even longer.\r\n\r\nFor more detailed technical description see please: https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/3202\r\n\r\nHowever, since we haven't been able to reproduce ANY of those issues mentioned above in-house during our tests, we kindly ask the community for help. To help with tracing those malfunctions, you can use the debugging tool described at the very beginning of these release notes.\r\n\r\nPlease, report any of those potential issues you discover on [GitHub](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/issues) and attach the Crash Dump file.\r\n\r\n### Long-Press action fixed\r\nIn the previous releases, the LCD knob \"Long press\" action was monitored and executed within the temperature control loop Interrupt Service Routine (ISR). This operation could under some circumstances destroy the menu buffer and create the menu itself inconsistently.\r\n\r\nThis change improves the printer reaction when the user is applying the \"Long press\" action (move Z etc. ). The main change is that the jog wheel \"Long press\" execution part has been moved to the main program loop. The temperature control loop is now exclusively dedicated to its generic task - temperature control.\r\n\r\n### Move auto reporting out of the temperature ISR\r\nThis change is similar to the Long-Press action described above. The code running in the temperature Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) needs to be fully reentrant, which is hard to keep for other than Temperature control tasks.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the auto reporting (response to M155) is moved to the main processing loop. This can make the auto reporting slower or irregular but removes the reentrant restriction, which allows to use “printf_P” to serial port and to keep Temperature ISR only for temperature control.\r\n\r\nFor more information head to: https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/3180\r\n\r\n### Uint8_t used consistently for the block buffer's index\r\nWe have identified and fixed another potential problem in the planner’s block buffer. The index was sometimes computed as an int (2 bytes), sometimes as 1-byte uint8_t. On the AVR working with 2-byte integers, this is generally not an atomic operation, because it takes multiple instructions to perform. Since it has been possible, all indices of the block buffer are now referenced as 1-byte uint8_t.\r\n\r\n### \"Preheating to load\" screen behavior fixed\r\nDuring the Load filament process, the printer was waiting for the preset temperature and displayed the \"Preheating to load\" message. When the user removed the SD card, the previous message was replaced by the message \"Card removed\" but the Preheating process still did not finish, so the lasting displayed message was not correct. Now after this and similar action the “Preheating to load\" message is redrawn again which is the correct Process status Message.\r\n\r\n### Message on boot while inserting SD card fixed\r\nWhen the user inserted the SD card during the booting process, the \"Sorting files\" message was presented twice on the display later followed by the correct \"Print from SD menu\" message. The issue has been reported on GitHub issue #3135 and clearly reproduced.\r\nWe have fixed the SD card handling while booting scenario, which corrected the double \"Sorting files\" message. Now the system works correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Algorithm for reading SN in EEPROM improved\r\nAnother significant improvement is a Serial Number (SN) reading algorithm change from the 32u2 communication chip. When reading the SN, the code is expected to start with the standard \"CZPX\" prefix used for all Prusa printers worldwide. Unsuccessful attempts are repeated until a valid SN is read.\r\n\r\n### Spanish translation fixed\r\nA tiny contribution from our community on improving wording in Spanish translation. Specifically for the text string: \"Was filament unload successful?\".\r\n\r\n### Firmware version parsing removed\r\nThis FW optimization has saved 936 bytes of Flash memory which is very important in the already critically occupied XFlash memory.\r\n\r\n### Prusa Connect & PrusaLink - beta testers wanted!\r\nWe are currently looking for enthusiastic and experienced owners of the Original Prusa MK3/MK3S/MK3S+ 3D printers, who will join us in the testing of our newest cloud-based printing service Prusa Connect.\r\n\r\nThe project is now in the beta stage and we would appreciate feedback from you. Selected beta testers will receive an RPi Zero W with pre-soldered GPIO pins together with step-by-step install instructions for the PrusaLink, access to Prusa Connect cloud service, and technical support. The next steps are the following: put your cloud-connected printer to work, run as many prints as you can and share any bugs and issues you find. Any suggestions and ideas are welcome!\r\n\r\nAre you interested?

These release notes include information provided in the previous releases RC1 and RC2.\r\n\r\nBefore we describe all the new features, improvements and changes, we would like to thank the entire Prusa community members for their feedback - especially all active members who helped us test and debug this firmware release. Your input is very much appreciated!\r\n\r\nThis release required:\r\n- 4500+ printing hours during our in-house testing\r\n- 867 commits to the source code\r\n- 80 pull requests\r\n- 11 contributors (5 of them external)\r\n\r\n### New “Print from SD” menu\r\nThe \"Print from SD\" menu was rewritten entirely. It is much more responsive when many files need to be displayed. This was accomplished by caching the file positions in memory during sorting. The menu isn't blocking anymore, so G-code commands can still be processed while the filename is scrolling on the screen. This should improve host software functionality and compatibility.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"FlashAir\" mode is enabled (for SD cards with Wi-Fi)  in the settings menu, a new menu button appears above the files and folders. It causes the menu to sort all items in the current directory again. This is useful when a file uploaded to the FlashAir card doesn't appear on the uppermost line - the user doesn't have to reset the printer or disconnect and reconnect the card.\r\n\r\nSorting is improved compared to the previous firmware releases. In general, Alphabetical sorting is now 10-15 % faster. Sorting of the files by time-stamp is now almost 2-4x faster.\r\n\r\n### \"Time Remaining\" function improved\r\nUntil now, the firmware was only able to display how much time remains until the print is finished. There were multiple suggestions from the community on further improvements. Starting this release, the developers have implemented the first stage. However, to make the function work correctly, the PrusaSlicer dev team also needs to publish a new release because the G-code instructions must be updated.\r\n\r\nOnce both firmware and PrusaSlicer are updated, the \"remaining time\" will work the following way. The printer will switch every 5 seconds between \"remaining-printing-time\" and \"time-to-next-color-change.\" Therefore the user will be informed in advance when the next filament change is expected.\r\n\r\nG-code M73 has been extended with two parameters: C (for normal mode) and D (for stealth mode). Until now, the PrusaSlicer produced pairs of lines in the form of (example):\r\n```\r\nM73 P15 R30\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce this feature is fully implemented, the code will look as follows:\r\n```\r\nM73 P15 R30 C15 \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means a color change is planned in 15 minutes in normal mode. In case you would like to try this feature now, you can edit the G-code manually using the code mentioned above. Adjust the parameter \"C\" according to your model's requirements.\r\n\r\nAlso, if the printer receives G-code “M73 C0”, it disables switching between “Time to finish” and “Time to color change”. However, this caused an issue during the last minute before the color change, when the printer stopped switching between these two values completely.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this scenario, the firmware was further adjusted. It is advised for the slicer software to use a floating-point value for the last minute before the color change (e.g. M73 C0.1) which is technically greater than zero and enables the function to work correctly.\r\n\r\n### Community translation\r\nThanks to the modifications to the part of the system responsible for storing the language dictionaries on the printer (XFLASH), the firmware can now extend the library of the official languages by loading new translations made by the community.\r\n\r\nOur first addition is Dutch, which is fully translated thanks to @3D-gussner and  @vintagePC. To select this language and other new translations in the future, please head to the LCD menu -> Settings -> Select language -> Community made. In this release, the only option is \"Nederlands.\"   \r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img width=\"700\" alt=\"Community made\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/111671142-ea835400-8818-11eb-9dd7-c35c0c59dd81.gif\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe welcome everyone to join us and localize the printer to their native language. In case you would like to translate and maintain the translations, contact us at info@prusa3d.com. We appreciate community members, who already signed up and we will contact them shortly with instructions.\r\n\r\n### Faster and quieter XYZ calibration\r\nAs noted in the previous release notes, the algorithm behind the XYZ calibration was almost completely rewritten, but developers are still looking for improvements. This release brings a bit faster, more precise, and also quieter calibration. The algorithm has both improved acceleration handling and a more robust scan (circle search).\r\n\r\nAnother improvement to the XYZ calibration is the skew analysis. Previously, the user was informed on the screen about the measured skew. Starting with this firmware release, the calibration values can also be accessed over the serial line for advanced diagnostics if anything goes wrong.\r\n\r\nDuring extensive internal testing of the XYZ calibration, it was discovered that in certain rare scenarios the data provided by the sensor are not handled correctly. The developers have improved the algorithm and if this scenario happens, the scan of the recent calibration points is automatically repeated.\r\n\r\n### PVB preheat preset\r\nIn the preheat preset menu a new entry for PVB filament has been added, with temperatures 215 °C / 75 °C. To learn more about PVB material, visit the [blog article](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/prusament-pvb-our-new-transparent-filament-made-for-easy-chemical-smoothing_43066/).\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img width=\"700\" alt=\"PVB\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/111671194-fcfd8d80-8818-11eb-82f1-4b565d97ec25.PNG\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### Satin sheet profiles\r\nThe developers have modified the default sheet profile list. It takes effect on new printers delivered with firmware 3.10.0, or after the Sheet profile reset and Factory reset with “All data” is executed on this firmware release or later.\r\n\r\nTwo new sheet names (Satin 1 and Satin 2) were introduced and “Custom 3” and “Custom 4” have been removed. As there are only 8 sheet profiles, only “Custom 1” and “Custom 2” remain at the end of the list. It is important to note that all profiles have the same default settings and the only difference is in the name.\r\n\r\nThe new default sheet profile list is as follows:\r\nSmooth1  \r\nSmooth2  \r\nTextur1  \r\nTextur2  \r\nSatin 1  \r\nSatin 2  \r\nCustom1  \r\nCustom2\r\n\r\nYou can edit the default names of the sheets via LCD Menu -> Settings -> HW Setup -> Steel Sheets -> [sheet name] -> Rename.\r\n\r\nKudos to @awenelo for this pull request. Fixes enhancement request #3051.\r\n\r\n### G-code \"M204 T\" implemented\r\nAnother extension of the G-code support is an implementation of \"M204 T\", which enables separate acceleration control of travel moves (now separated from the print moves). With this change, the syntax and behavior of M204 are now identical to Marlin 2.\r\n\r\nA separate travel acceleration setting allows reducing the number of instructions required while printing. Resetting the acceleration just for travel moves is no longer required and can be done a single time during the print.\r\n\r\nM204 has two forms:\r\n- the legacy format:\r\n```\r\nM204 S[print-acc] T[retract-acc]\r\n```\r\n\r\n- the newer format:\r\n```\r\nM204 P[print-acc] R[retract-acc] T[travel-acc]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe distinction is made based on the presence of the P parameter. If P is included in the G-code, the new format is used. To keep backward compatibility, the \"M204 S[acc]\" will set both print and travel acceleration, which is identical in behavior to existing firmware versions. M500 and M503 will now also report settings using the \"new format.\"\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the PR #2838\r\n\r\n### Optimizations for the MK3 filament sensor\r\nThe PAT9125 on the MK3 is attached to the hardware SDA/SCL pins, however, it was using a software two-wire interface (TWI) implementation.\r\n\r\nThe code now includes the PAT9125_I2C configuration option (enabled by default) to use the hardware TWI module in 400kHz fast mode instead. The change saves a few bytes in all variants while also improving the performance of optical filament sensor checks in the MK3.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the PR #2814\r\n\r\n### DEDGE support enabled for TMC2130\r\nThe Trinamic driver TMC2130 supports Double Edge stepping (DEDGE) where both the rising and falling edge of the step pin count as a step instead of requiring a full cycle.\r\n\r\nUsing DEDGE is beneficial - it removes one extra toggle for each step pulse (plus a delay, in some circumstances), saving a few µs in hot code paths while stepping.\r\n\r\nThis release introduces 2 macros to step: STEP_NC_HI and STEP_NC_LO. In legacy mode, both perform as their name implies. In DEDGE mode instead, STEP_NC_HI inverts the line, while STEP_NC_LO becomes a no-op. Both modes are still fully supported, but DEDGE is now enabled by default in all supported variants. The macros are specialized for each axis and still respect INVERT_?_AXIS as defined in the variant file.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the firmware introduces a few constant definitions for the delays required by the TMC2130 and uses them when appropriate instead of hard-coding delays:\r\n- step pauses (2µs minimum)\r\n- direction changes (100µs minimum)\r\n\r\nExisting code that was manipulating the pins directly has been changed to use either the macros or the helper functions defined in tmc2130.h. We also fixed the behavior of TMC2130_INTPOL_* (which was previously ignored) in the variant files.\r\n\r\nNote that this feature will only be present on MK3, MK3S and MK3S+ printers.\r\n\r\nFor more information see the PR #2789\r\n\r\n### Improved filament troubleshooting\r\nWhen using the Settings->Move->Extruder menu the filament sensor is now temporarily ignored.\r\n\r\nThanks to this change, it is now possible to use the Move menu to control the extruder while trying to perform a manual filament swap, (e.g. when trying to clear a filament clog or when untangling a stuck flexible filament). There is no need to use the filament-change procedure, which was sometimes used by the users instead to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the PR #1758\r\n\r\n### Support for 0.8mm nozzles\t\r\nA new 0.8mm nozzle preset has been added to the firmware in the “HW setup” section. The user can set the printer to verify whether the G-code was sliced correctly for the selected nozzle diameter. Currently available sizes are 0.25, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 mm.\r\n\r\n### Support for a GD external FLASH chip\r\nAs mentioned in the previous firmware releases, the Covid-19 virus is negatively impacting worldwide supplies, and to be able to ship the printers continuously without any significant delay, we have started to look for alternative verified suppliers of the most critical parts.\r\n\r\nIn this release, we are extending system support for external FLASH chip GD25Q20CEIGR from company GigaDevice to ensure our production of Einsy boards remains unrestricted. For the user, there is no impact on the functionality of the printer, everything remains the same.\r\n\r\n### Optimizations for print hosts (e.g. Octoprint)\r\nTo improve the experience while printing using a remote host, there are several changes and optimizations in this release.\r\n\r\n#### G-code M155 support\r\nThe firmware introduces support for an M155 G-code (Automatically send temperatures) which creates the same output as M105 (Get Extruder Temperature), but it provides it automatically without the need to periodically receive M105 G-code from Octoprint or other serial devices.\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\nAdded G-code M123 to show fan speed tacho and PWM values\r\n\r\nExtended Capabilities in G-code M115\r\nAUTOREPORT_FANS\r\nAUTOREPORT_POSITION\r\nAdded parameter C to G-code M155 to de-/activate auto report output using a bitmask\r\n\r\n#### SD card status send automatically\r\nPreviously the firmware didn't always properly report the current SD card status over the serial line. This is now fixed and the firmware reports three statuses: Insert, Eject and Error.\r\n\r\n#### LCD status over UART\r\nWhen the LCD status changes, the printer will send an \"LCD status changed\" message to the serial line.\r\n\r\n#### Add printer sleep information to the M115\r\nExtended printer status information by reporting \"Print paused\" on the serial line as a response to an M115 G-code.\r\n\r\n#### Serial number in EEPROM\r\nIt was impossible to retrieve the serial number from the 32u2 IC when the USB cable was unplugged. With this fix, the serial number is cached to EEPROM at startup to have it available at all times even if the USB is not powered. This should also allow a connected RPi to be able to retrieve it.\r\n\r\n#### Printer state in INFO string\r\nExtending printer status information by \"Print paused\" in serial line as a response for received M115 G-code.\r\n\r\n#### IP address in the Support menu\r\nPreviously, when an IP address was assigned to the host/printer, it was displayed on the status screen. However, it was often rewritten by other status information from the system seconds later. In this release, the IP address will be also displayed in the LCD menu -> Support Menu. In case the FlashAir SD card is used, both IP addresses will be displayed.\r\n\r\nThe host must send it to the printer in the following format:\r\nM552 P192.168.1.14\r\n_Note that the IP address is used as an example - yours might be different. The printer remembers the IP address until the restart._\r\n\r\n#### Pause/Resume functions improved\r\nUntil this release, the host and the printer weren't always correctly synced while a Print/Pause/Resume/Stop was applied either in the host interface or directly on the printer using the knob. Now, the user can control the printer from both places without the risk of a print failure. The printer and the host are actively communicating and exchanging information.\r\n\r\nExamples of the shared information:\r\n- print: // action:pause \r\n- print: // action:resume\r\n\r\n#### Support for G-codes with thumbnails\r\nThere have been significant improvements to how fast G-code files are processed (almost 10x increase) when reading from the SD card, specifically when processing comment lines. This allows for a fast skipping of large comment blocks (especially PNG thumbnails) throughout the file.\r\n\r\nThis has resulted in several improvements:\r\n- Sliced G-codes for 8bit printers can now contain thumbnails\r\n- The file check right before the start of an SD print is much faster\r\n- More of the (limited) CPU power is now available for other tasks like stepping the motors, linear advance and other core runtime features\r\n\r\nThe firmware is now able to skip through commented lines at speeds reaching 170 KB/s (the raw read speed of the SD card in SPI mode has a maximum of approximately 250 KB/s). The average PNG thumbnail is less than 100 kB, so skipping over this should take less than a second.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is possible to generate many big thumbnails in the G-code. In such a situation, starting the print will take several seconds (based on the size of comment lines you put in). However, it will not crash anymore.\r\n\r\nExisting Octoprint plugins which extract thumbnails from the G-code should still work, as there were no changes to the G-code format.\r\n\r\n#### M601/M602 confirmation statuses fixed \r\nFixed missing “Ok” in M601 and double “Ok” in M602 on the serial line.\r\n\r\n### Optimized code size and RAM usage\t\r\nBy removing string literals from RAM, the memory usage was decreased below 6 KB. As a result, firmware 3.10.0 can now perform better under certain scenarios.\r\n\r\nA lot of old code that was related to serial output or LCD rendering was improved. There were many cases where PROGMEM wasn't used or string literals were used for a single character. Some locations were updated to use the appropriate function for generating many spaces on the LCD, as opposed to saving a string consisting only of spaces to PROGMEM.\r\n\r\nThe developers have also refactored some of the serial messages to use fewer function calls (resulting in reduced flash usage). Similarly, some of them were packed to a single printf_P call.\r\n\r\n### Scaling extruder motor current based on speed\r\nThe developers have discovered that using StealthChop without the “current feedback” feature of the TMC2130 has a positive effect on the extruder motor temperature. Multiple tests on our farm have shown that the temperature can be lowered by up to 10° C.\r\n\r\nWARNING: This feature was tested only for the motors provided by Prusa Research. We cannot guarantee that this current amplification can be applied to other 3rd party motors as they might get damaged due to a current spike. For this very reason, the feature is disabled for all printers and has to be manually enabled at the user's risk.\r\n\r\nTo enable this feature, enter the experimental menu. Go to LCD menu -> Settings -> HW Setup, then scroll to any menu item and hold the knob for 2-3 seconds. After a “click” sound, the display will flash once and the “experimental menu” will appear as the last item in the list. Open the experimental menu, then select the \"E-cool mode\" and switch it to \"ON\".\r\n\r\n### File listing adjusted for remote printing software\r\nThe file listing provided by the M20 G-code was adjusted to comply with the needs of the remote printing software like OctoPrint.\r\n\r\nExamples of the listing when using plain G-code M20, or M20 with the parameter “L”:\r\nM20:\r\n```\r\nBegin file list\r\nTEST1.GCO 1234\r\nLFNFIL~1.GCO 1234\r\nEnd file list\r\n```\r\n\r\nM20 L:\r\n```\r\nBegin file list\r\nTEST1.GCO 1234 \"TEST1.GCO\"\r\nDIR_ENTER: /TESTFO~1/ \"test folder\"\r\nDIR_EXIT\r\nLFNFIL~1.GCO 1234 \"LFN file.gcode\"\r\nEnd file list\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor Prusa Connect, the firmware was extended by a “T” parameter, which lists timestamps of the files. Both “L” and “T” parameters can be also used at the same time. The timestamp is a combination of both the date and time into a single integer ((date << 16) | time) and printed as a hex value. More information about the design is available at [link1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_the_FAT_file_system#DIR_OFS_0Eh), [link2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_the_FAT_file_system#DIR_OFS_10h)\r\n\r\nExamples of the listing, while using single parameter “T” and combination of “L” and “T”:\r\nM20 L T:\r\n```\r\nBegin file list\r\nTEST1.GCO 1234 0x52936b00 \"TEST1.GCO\"\r\nDIR_ENTER: /TESTFO~1/ \"test folder\"\r\nDIR_EXIT\r\nLFNFIL~1.GCO 1234 0x52936b08 \"LFN file.gcode\"\r\nEnd file list\r\n```\r\n\r\nM20 T:\r\n```\r\nBegin file list\r\nTEST1.GCO 1234 0x52936b00\r\nLFNFIL~1.GCO 1234 0x52936b08\r\nEnd file list \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Host Long File Name (LFN) improvements\r\nUnder the hood, the SD FAT implementation in the firmware only uses 8.3 DOS filenames. This is fine when they’re internal to the firmware, but this has the side effect of requiring Host software to work with 8.3 filenames (SFN) exclusively. To address this limitation, a few changes to existing G-codes are proposed. If these G-codes are used correctly, the Host software can build the full file tree with both SFN and LFN, while also knowing how to start an SD print with M23 (which still requires SFN).\r\nThe affected G-code commands are M20 and M27. More info about what was changed can be found in these two pull-requests:\r\n- PR https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/3009\r\n- PR https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/2987\r\n\r\n### Z offset during M600 reverted\r\nThis change restores the minimum extruder height for filament purge during M600 from the current value of 50 mm back to 27 mm used in the previous release FW 3.9.3 for the convenience of the user. \r\n\r\n### Factory reset menu extended\r\nThe factory reset menu is extended in this release with a new “Service prep” option, which was requested by the Prusa Service department. Just before a repaired printer is sent back to the customer, this option is activated. The printer is then ready to guide the user through the “after-service” unpacking procedure.\r\n\r\nThis procedure is similar to another option from the menu called “Shipping prep”. The only difference is that “Service prep” does not clear the print statistics. The \"All data\" parameter was moved into the last parameter position (after the Service prep parameter).\r\n\r\n### G-code documentation updated\r\nThis update brings updates to several G-codes (M20, M73, M123 and M155), the documentation was updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Translations updated and checked\r\nAll language versions of the firmware were updated and verified using new scripts, which check for the proper text wrapping according to the size of the LCD screen. As a result, the text readability is improved.\r\n\r\n### Reservation in the EEPROM for job ID tracking\r\nFor the host software, there is now a reserved space in the EEPROM to track/identify the print job. Even if the SD card or Raspberry Pi becomes unresponsive, the job ID will prevail. The 4-bytes variable in EEPROM is named \"EEVAR_HOST_JOBID\". Host software can manipulate the EEPROM variable via D3 commands.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n#### Incorrect G-code reading from a buffer \r\nThere was a bug in the new G-code reading code, which could stop the print in progress. In some scenarios, the system would insert a new line '\\n' into the current cached block of the G-code file and change the G-code line syntax. Kudos to @lhecker for reporting the issue and providing a good test case (fixes issue #3077).\r\n\r\n#### M120 and M121 disabled\r\nFrom now on, G-codes M120 and M121 have been disabled as they do not function correctly and cause issues when used in the G-code file. If necessary, advanced users can enable them in the FW code and recompile.\r\n\r\n#### Crash detection during MBL \r\nNormally, if prior to Mesh Bed Leveling (MBL) a crash on the Y-axis is detected, the MBL is repeated again and print coordinates are verified, then a purge line is printed. In some scenarios starting firmware 3.9.0 (previous releases are not affected), the purge line was incorrectly placed in the center of the sheet, now this is fixed and the purge line is correctly placed in the front-left position.\r\n\r\n#### M0/M1 Stop/Halt not displaying text/waiting for input fixed\r\nFixes M0 and M1 commands:\r\n- G-code M1 must have a string, while in M0 it is optional\r\n- G-codes M0/M1 were moved to the beginning of the parser to allow reading “M1” first instead of M1nn.\r\n\r\nThe parser would not be able to \"find\" M1nn command if the query was “M1 “ instead of “M1” (space behind) to be able to \"stop/halt\" without sending a string and displaying the default message. \r\n- Use G-code M0 as there are no M0nn G-codes the parser can identify M0 without additional space needed as in M1\r\n- M0/M1 with parameters P or S will NOT show any text as mentioned in #2055 (comment)\r\n\r\nIn Octoprint, M0 or M1 should not be in \"Pausing commands\" as these are NOT pause commands - they stop/halt/sleep the printer. Addressing few requests from #2055. Thanks to @vojtech-pavlik and his PR #1900, which we merged with a few improvements.\r\n\r\n**It is important to note that G-code M0/M1 stops/halts the printer! If you need a pause, please use M601.**\r\n\r\n#### Sensor info screen blocking the function of filament IR sensor fixed\r\nNow the function of the filament sensor is not blocked during print if in Support->Sensor info screen is displayed.  If the printer is idle the filament sensor actions are disabled while in the ‘Support->Sensor info’ menu. This allows the user to troubleshoot this sensor (broken wire, etc).\r\nFixes issue #1971\r\n\r\n#### Move Z up before XYZ calibration\r\nThe Z-axis is now raised up prior to the XYZ calibration to prevent scratching the bed, sheet, and nozzle.\r\n\r\n#### Firmware retract (G10/G11) fixed\r\nWhen using firmware retract (as controlled by M207/M208), G10 would previously save an incorrect offset, resulting in an incorrect “unretract” move on the subsequent G11. The offset is now saved correctly, fixing the behavior of G10/G11.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see PR #2572 \r\n\r\n#### Babystep insertion fixed\r\nThis functionality prevents the user from entering Live Z (through long-press or via the menu) while performing mesh bed leveling, homing, or performing individual Z probes via G30. These actions interfere with each other and can result in an incorrect mesh or Z offset. \r\n\r\nThe firmware now restricts this by setting/checking for the mesh_bed_leveling/homing flag when relevant. The code around Babystep insertion was also cleaned up (notably, the alternative to BABYSTEP_LOADZ_BY_PLANNER was broken and has been removed).\r\n\r\nFor more information, see PR #3006\r\n\r\n#### Opening file causing wrong serial output fixed\r\nOpening a file from the LCD menu would open the file twice. This behavior is normal. However, the first time the file was opened, the wrong filename was displayed in the serial output, possibly confusing the host software. Now, this bug is fixed.\r\n\r\n#### SD card (re)print bug in Octoprint fixed\r\n\r\nWhen the user started a Print From SD Card from Octoprint in the RC1 or RC2 firmware release, the print finished successfully, but it would immediately start again. This would result in crashes and homing failures due to printed material still being present on the heatbed. This issue did not occur on the previous stable release 3.9.3, and has been corrected in this final release.\r\n\r\nFixes issue #3102\r\n",

For the user, there is no impact on the functionality of the printer, everything remains the same.\r\n\r\n### Reservation in the EEPROM for job ID tracking\r\nFor the host software, there is now a reserved space in the EEPROM to track/identify the print job. Even if the SD card or Raspberry Pi becomes unresponsive, the job ID will prevail. The 4-bytes variable in EEPROM is named \"EEVAR_HOST_JOBID\". Host software can manipulate the EEPROM variable via D3 commands.\r\n\r\n### XYZ calibration algorithm improved\r\nDuring extensive internal testing of the XYZ calibration, it was discovered that in certain rare scenarios the data provided by the sensor are not handled correctly. The developers have improved the algorithm and if this scenario happens, the scan of the recent calibration points is automatically repeated.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n#### Incorrect G-code reading from a buffer \r\nThere was a bug in the new G-code reading code, which could stop the print in progress. In some scenarios, the system would insert a new line '\\n' into the current cached block of the G-code file and change the G-code line syntax. Kudos to @lhecker for reporting the issue and providing a good test case (fixes issue #3077).\r\n\r\n#### \"Time Remaining\" function bug fixed\r\nIf the printer receives G-code “M73 C0”, it disables switching between “Time to finish” and “Time to color change”. However, this caused an issue during the last minute before the color change, when the printer stopped switching between these two values completely.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this scenario, the firmware was adjusted. It is advised for the slicer software to use a floating-point value for the last minute before the color change (e.g. M73 C0.1) which is technically greater than zero and enables the function to work correctly.\r\n\r\n#### M120 and M121 disabled\r\nFrom now on, G-codes M120 and M121 have been disabled as they do not function correctly and cause issues when used in the G-code file. If necessary, advanced users can enable them in the FW code and recompile.\r\n\r\n#### Crash detection during MBL \r\nNormally, if prior to Mesh Bed Leveling (MBL) a crash on the Y-axis is detected, the MBL is repeated again and print coordinates are verified, then a purge line is printed. In some scenarios starting firmware 3.9.0 (previous releases are not affected), the purge line was incorrectly placed in the center of the sheet, now this is fixed and the purge line is correctly placed in the front-left position.

It is much more responsive when many files need to be displayed. This was accomplished by caching the file positions in memory during sorting. The menu isn't blocking anymore, so G-code commands can still be processed while the filename is scrolling on the screen. This should improve host software functionality and compatibility.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"FlashAir\" mode is enabled (for SD cards with Wi-Fi)  in the settings menu, a new menu button appears above the files and folders. It causes the menu to sort all items in the current directory again. This is useful when a file uploaded to the FlashAir card doesn't appear on the uppermost line - the user doesn't have to reset the printer or disconnect and reconnect the card.\r\n\r\nSorting is improved compared to the previous firmware releases. In general, Alphabetical sorting is now 10-15 % faster. Sorting of the files by time-stamp is now almost 2-4x faster.\r\n\r\n### \"Time Remaining\" function improved\r\nUntil now, the firmware was only able to display how much time remains until the print is finished. There were multiple suggestions from the community on further improvements. Starting this release, the developers have implemented the first stage. However, to make the function work correctly, the PrusaSlicer dev team also needs to publish a new release because the G-code instructions must be updated.\r\n\r\nOnce both firmware and PrusaSlicer are updated, the \"remaining time\" will work the following way. The printer will switch every 5 seconds between \"remaining-printing-time\" and \"time-to-next-color-change.\" Therefore the user will be informed in advance when the next filament change is expected.\r\n\r\nG-code M73 has been extended with two parameters: C (for normal mode) and D (for stealth mode). Until now, the PrusaSlicer produced pairs of lines in the form of (example):\r\nM73 P15 R30\r\n\r\nOnce this feature is fully implemented, the code will look as follows:\r\nM73 P15 R30 C15 \r\n\r\nThis means a color change is planned in 15 minutes in normal mode. Note that this feature is still a \"work in progress,\" and there might be some changes before the final release. In case you would like to try this feature now, you can edit the G-code manually using the code mentioned above. Adjust the parameter \"C\" according to your model's requirements.\r\n\r\n### Community translation\r\nThanks to the modifications to the part of the system responsible for storing the language dictionaries on the printer (XFLASH), the firmware can now extend the library of the official languages by loading new translations made by the community.\r\n\r\nOur first addition is Dutch, which is fully translated thanks to @3D-gussner and  @vintagePC. To select this language and other new translations in the future, please head to the LCD menu -> Settings -> Select language -> Community made. In this release, the only option is \"Nederlands.\"   \r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img width=\"700\" alt=\"Community made\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/111671142-ea835400-8818-11eb-9dd7-c35c0c59dd81.gif\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe welcome everyone to join us and localize the printer to their native language. In case you would like to translate and maintain the translations, contact us at info@prusa3d.com\r\n\r\nAlong with the community translations, the officially supported languages were updated.\r\n\r\n### Faster and quieter XYZ calibration\r\nAs noted in the previous release notes, the algorithm behind the XYZ calibration was almost completely rewritten, but developers are still looking for improvements. This release brings a bit faster, more precise, and also quieter calibration. The algorithm has both improved acceleration handling and a more robust scan (circle search).\r\n\r\nAnother improvement to the XYZ calibration is the skew analysis. Previously, the user was informed on the screen about the measured skew. Starting with this firmware release, the calibration values can also be accessed over the serial line for advanced diagnostics if anything goes wrong.\r\n\r\n### PVB preheat preset\r\nIn the preheat preset menu a new entry for PVB filament has been added, with temperatures 215 °C / 75 °C. To learn more about PVB material, visit the [blog article](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/prusament-pvb-our-new-transparent-filament-made-for-easy-chemical-smoothing_43066/).\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img width=\"700\" alt=\"PVB\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/111671194-fcfd8d80-8818-11eb-82f1-4b565d97ec25.PNG\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### G-code \"M204 T\" implemented\r\nAnother extension of the G-code support is an implementation of \"M204 T\", which enables separate acceleration control of travel moves (now separated from the print moves). With this change, the syntax and behavior of M204 are now identical to Marlin 2.\r\n\r\nA separate travel acceleration setting allows reducing the number of instructions required while printing. Resetting the acceleration just for travel moves is no longer required and can be done a single time during the print.\r\n\r\nM204 has two forms:\r\n- the legacy format:\r\nM204 S[print-acc] T[retract-acc]\r\n\r\n- the newer format:\r\nM204 P[print-acc] R[retract-acc] T[travel-acc]\r\n\r\nThe distinction is made based on the presence of the P parameter. If P is included in the G-code, the new format is used. To keep backward compatibility, the \"M204 S[acc]\" will set both print and travel acceleration, which is identical in behavior to existing firmware versions. M500 and M503 will now also report settings using the \"new format.\"\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the PR #2838\r\n\r\n### Optimizations for the MK3 filament sensor \r\nThe PAT9125 on the MK3 is attached to the hardware SDA/SCL pins, however, it was using a software two-wire interface (TWI) implementation.\r\n\r\nThe code now includes the PAT9125_I2C configuration option (enabled by default) to use the hardware TWI module in 400kHz fast mode instead. The change saves a few bytes in all variants while also improving the performance of optical filament sensor checks in the MK3.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the PR #2814\r\n\r\n### DEDGE support enabled for TMC2130\r\nThe Trinamic driver TMC2130 supports Double Edge stepping (DEDGE) where both the rising and falling edge of the step pin count as a step instead of requiring a full cycle.\r\n\r\nUsing DEDGE is beneficial - it removes one extra toggle for each step pulse (plus a delay, in some circumstances), saving a few µs in hot code paths while stepping.\r\n\r\nThis release introduces 2 macros to step: STEP_NC_HI and STEP_NC_LO. In legacy mode, both perform as their name implies. In DEDGE mode instead, STEP_NC_HI inverts the line, while STEP_NC_LO becomes a no-op. Both modes are still fully supported, but DEDGE is now enabled by default in all supported variants. The macros are specialized for each axis and still respect INVERT_?_AXIS as defined in the variant file.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the firmware introduces a few constant definitions for the delays required by the TMC2130 and uses them when appropriate instead of hard-coding delays:\r\n- step pauses (2µs minimum)\r\n- direction changes (100µs minimum)\r\n\r\nExisting code that was manipulating the pins directly has been changed to use either the macros or the helper functions defined in tmc2130.h. We also fixed the behavior of TMC2130_INTPOL_* (which was previously ignored) in the variant files.\r\n\r\nNote that this feature will only be present on MK3, MK3S and MK3S+ printers.\r\n\r\nFor more information see the PR #2789\r\n\r\n### Improved filament troubleshooting\r\nWhen using the Settings->Move->Extruder menu the filament sensor is now temporarily ignored.\r\n\r\nThanks to this change, it is now possible to use the Move menu to control the extruder while trying to perform a manual filament swap, (e.g. when trying to clear a filament clog or when untangling a stuck flexible filament). There is no need to use the filament-change procedure, which was sometimes used by the users instead to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the PR #1758\r\n\r\n### Support for 0.8mm nozzles\t\r\nA new 0.8mm nozzle preset has been added to the firmware in the “HW setup” section. The user can set the printer to verify whether the G-code was sliced correctly for the selected nozzle diameter. Currently available sizes are 0.25, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 mm.\r\n\r\n### Optimizations for print hosts (e.g. Octoprint)\r\nTo improve the experience while printing using a remote host, there are several changes and optimizations in this release.\r\n\r\n#### G-code M155 support\r\nThe firmware introduces support for an M155 G-code (Automatically send temperatures) which creates the same output as M105 (Get Extruder Temperature), but it provides it automatically without the need to periodically receive M105 G-code from Octoprint or other serial devices.\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\nAdded G-code M123 to show fan speed tacho and PWM values\r\n\r\nExtended Capabilities in G-code M115\r\nAUTOREPORT_FANS\r\nAUTOREPORT_POSITION\r\nAdded parameter C to G-code M155 to de-/activate auto report output using a bitmask\r\n\r\n#### SD card status send automatically\r\nPreviously the firmware didn't always properly report the current SD card status over the serial line. This is now fixed and the firmware reports three statuses: Insert, Eject and Error.\r\n\r\n#### Host Long File Name (LFN) improvements\r\nUnder the hood, the SD FAT implementation in the firmware only uses 8.3 DOS filenames. This is fine when they’re internal to the firmware, but this has the side effect of requiring Host software to work with 8.3 filenames (SFN) exclusively. To address this limitation, a few changes to existing G-codes are proposed. If these G-codes are used correctly, the Host software can build the full file tree with both SFN and LFN, while also knowing how to start an SD print with M23 (which still requires SFN).\r\nThe affected G-code commands are M20 and M27. More info about what was changed can be found in these two pull-requests:\r\n- PR https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/3009\r\n- PR https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/2987\r\n \r\n\r\n#### LCD status over UART\r\nWhen the LCD status changes, the printer will send an \"LCD status changed\" message to the serial line.\r\n\r\n#### Add printer sleep information to the M115\r\nExtended printer status information by reporting \"Print paused\" on the serial line as a response to an M115 G-code.\r\n\r\n#### Serial number in EEPROM\r\nIt was impossible to retrieve the serial number from the 32u2 IC when the USB cable was unplugged. With this fix, the serial number is cached to EEPROM at startup to have it available at all times even if the USB is not powered. This should also allow a connected RPi to be able to retrieve it.\r\n\r\n#### Printer state in INFO string\r\nExtending printer status information by \"Print paused\" in serial line as a response for received M115 G-code.\r\n\r\n#### IP address in the Support menu\r\nPreviously, when an IP address was assigned to the host/printer, it was displayed on the status screen. However, it was often rewritten by other status information from the system seconds later. In this release, the IP address will be also displayed in the LCD menu -> Support Menu. In case the FlashAir SD card is used, both IP addresses will be displayed.\r\n\r\nThe host must send it to the printer in the following format:\r\nM552 P192.168.1.14\r\n_Note that the IP address is used as an example - yours might be different. The printer remembers the IP address until the restart._\r\n\r\n#### Pause/Resume functions improved\r\nUntil this release, the host and the printer weren't always correctly synced while a Print/Pause/Resume/Stop was applied either in the host interface or directly on the printer using the knob. Now, the user can control the printer from both places without the risk of a print failure. The printer and the host are actively communicating and exchanging information.\r\n\r\nExamples of the shared information:\r\n- print: // action:pause \r\n- print: // action:resume\r\n\r\n#### Support for G-codes with thumbnails\r\nThere have been significant improvements to how fast G-code files are processed (almost 10x increase) when reading from the SD card, specifically when processing comment lines. This allows for a fast skipping of large comment blocks (especially PNG thumbnails) throughout the file.\r\n\r\nThis has resulted in several improvements:\r\n- Sliced G-codes for 8bit printers can now contain thumbnails\r\n- The file check right before the start of an SD print is much faster\r\n- More of the (limited) CPU power is now available for other tasks like stepping the motors, linear advance and other core runtime features\r\n\r\nThe firmware is now able to skip through commented lines at speeds reaching 170 KB/s (the raw read speed of the SD card in SPI mode has a maximum of approximately 250 KB/s). The average PNG thumbnail is less than 100 kB, so skipping over this should take less than a second.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is possible to generate many big thumbnails in the G-code. In such a situation, starting the print will take several seconds (based on the size of comment lines you put in). However, it will not crash anymore.\r\n\r\nExisting Octoprint plugins which extract thumbnails from the G-code should still work, as there were no changes to the G-code format.\r\n\r\n#### M601/M602 confirmation statuses fixed \r\nFixed missing “Ok” in M601 and double “Ok” in M602 on the serial line.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Optimized code size and RAM usage\t\r\nBy removing string literals from RAM, the memory usage was decreased below 6 KB. As a result, firmware 3.10.0 can now perform better under certain scenarios.\r\n\r\nA lot of old code that was related to serial output or LCD rendering was improved. There were many cases where PROGMEM wasn't used or string literals were used for a single character. Some locations were updated to use the appropriate function for generating many spaces on the LCD, as opposed to saving a string consisting only of spaces to PROGMEM.\r\n\r\nThe developers have also refactored some of the serial messages to use fewer function calls (resulting in reduced flash usage). Similarly, some of them were packed to a single printf_P call.\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n#### M0/M1 Stop/Halt not displaying text/waiting for input fixed\r\nFixes M0 and M1 commands:\r\n- G-code M1 must have a string, while in M0 it is optional\r\n- G-codes M0/M1 were moved to the beginning of the parser to allow reading “M1” first instead of M1nn.\r\n\r\nThe parser would not be able to \"find\" M1nn command if the query was “M1 “ instead of “M1” (space behind) to be able to \"stop/halt\" without sending a string and displaying the default message. \r\n- Use G-code M0 as there are no M0nn G-codes the parser can identify M0 without additional space needed as in M1\r\n- M0/M1 with parameters P or S will NOT show any text as mentioned in #2055 (comment)\r\n\r\nIn Octoprint, M0 or M1 should not be in \"Pausing commands\" as these are NOT pause commands - they stop/halt/sleep the printer. Addressing few requests from #2055. Thanks to @vojtech-pavlik and his PR #1900, which we merged with a few improvements.\r\n\r\n**It is important to note that G-code M0/M1 stops/halts the printer! If you need a pause, please use M601.**\r\n\r\n#### Sensor info screen blocking the function of filament IR sensor fixed\r\nNow the function of the filament sensor is not blocked during print if in Support->Sensor info screen is displayed.  If the printer is idle the filament sensor actions are disabled while in the ‘Support->Sensor info’ menu. This allows the user to troubleshoot this sensor (broken wire, etc).\r\nFixes issue #1971\r\n\r\n#### Move Z up before XYZ calibration\r\nThe X-axis is now raised up prior to the XYZ calibration to prevent scratching the bed, sheet, and nozzle.\r\n\r\n#### Firmware retract (G10/G11) fixed\r\nWhen using firmware retract (as controlled by M207/M208), G10 would previously save an incorrect offset, resulting in an incorrect “unretract” move on the subsequent G11. The offset is now saved correctly, fixing the behavior of G10/G11.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see PR #2572 \r\n\r\n#### Babystep insertion fixed\r\nThis functionality prevents the user from entering Live Z (through long-press or via the menu) while performing mesh bed leveling, homing, or performing individual Z probes via G30. These actions interfere with each other and can result in an incorrect mesh or Z offset. \r\n\r\nThe firmware now restricts this by setting/checking for the mesh_bed_leveling/homing flag when relevant. The code around Babystep insertion was also cleaned up (notably, the alternative to BABYSTEP_LOADZ_BY_PLANNER was broken and has been removed).\r\n\r\nFor more information, see PR #3006 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "## Summary\r\n- Redesigned XYZ calibration\r\n\r\nThis is the final release of the firmware 3.9.3 introducing redesigned XYZ calibration. There are no changes compared to the previous release 3.9.3-RC1.\r\n\r\n### Redesigned XYZ calibration\r\nStarting with the release of the Original Prusa i3 MK3S+ printer there is a new induction sensor called SuperPINDA, which is temperature-independent, features a much higher quality sensor and better quality components overall, plus, it does not need a thermistor. This sensor is a successor to the P.I.N.D.A. v2 (with thermistor) and is compatible with the following printers:\r\n- Original Prusa i3 MK3/MK3S/MK3S+\r\n- Original Prusa i3 MK2.5/MK2.5S\r\n\r\nIn order to use the full potential of both sensors, this firmware brings a significantly redesigned XYZ calibration. Previously, the data during the calibration were measured in one direction and approximated. Now, for both P.I.N.D.A. v2 and SuperPINDA the new algorithm measures 1024 points (32x32 bitmap) on the heatbed for each calibration point and utilizes z-hop on the Z-axis (multiple distances from the surface). The reason for multiple measurements is to mitigate the effect of the hysteresis* of the sensor. A similar method is used in the Mesh Bed Levelling (MBL).\r\n\r\n_*Every measurement sensor has its own hysteresis, which can be explained as a memory effect from the previous measurement. If you measure the first point, some of the energy remains in the sensor and affects the value in the second measured point. This effect has to be eliminated to provide accurate data._\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"Calibration_point_FW393\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/103154973-ec9ac100-479b-11eb-8428-16dbf746a0b9.jpg\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">Calibration point on the heatbed \"as seen\" by the printer</p>\r\n\r\nFrom the measured data, the printer now performs a subpixel processing of the scanned 32x32 bitmap and detects very precisely the center of each calibration point. More precise data of the printer's overall geometry (e.q. axis skew) helps the printer to apply appropriate adjustments resulting in a better print accuracy. Note that this new XYZ calibration requires more time (around 20-25 minutes) to scan and evaluate all the calibration points.\r\n\r\nThis new method also replaces the last step of the older process, where the exact center of each calibration point was iteratively searched using a cross-search technique. The previous “whole-pixel” search was providing an accuracy of about 0.6 mm. Now, it is less than 0.1 mm thanks to the sub-pixel analysis.\r\n\r\nPerforming this new XYZ calibration on a calibrated printer is not necessary unless you are experiencing issues with your prints. Note that 3D printers from the MK3 family recognize this new sensor automatically. However, in the case of MK2.5/MK2.5S, the user needs to toggle a switch in the settings menu (LCD Menu -> Settings -> HW settings -> SuperPINDA -> ON/OFF) to inform the printer that the SuperPINDA sensor is present as the printer cannot recognize it automatically."

    "body": "\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n- Redesigned XYZ calibration\r\n\r\n### Redesigned XYZ calibration\r\nStarting with the release of the Original Prusa i3 MK3S+ printer there is a new induction sensor called SuperPINDA, which is temperature-independent, features a much higher quality sensor and better quality components overall, plus, it does not need a thermistor. This sensor is a successor to the P.I.N.D.A. v2 (with thermistor) and is compatible with the following printers:\r\n- Original Prusa i3 MK3/MK3S/MK3S+\r\n- Original Prusa i3 MK2.5/MK2.5S\r\n\r\nIn order to use the full potential of both sensors, this firmware brings a significantly redesigned XYZ calibration. Previously, the data during the calibration were measured in one direction and approximated. Now, for both P.I.N.D.A. v2 and SuperPINDA the new algorithm measures 1024 points (32x32 bitmap) on the heatbed for each calibration point and utilizes z-hop on the Z-axis (multiple distances from the surface). The reason for multiple measurements is to mitigate the effect of the hysteresis* of the sensor. A similar method is used in the Mesh Bed Levelling (MBL).\r\n\r\n_*Every measurement sensor has its own hysteresis, which can be explained as a memory effect from the previous measurement. If you measure the first point, some of the energy remains in the sensor and affects the value in the second measured point. This effect has to be eliminated to provide accurate data._\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"Calibration_point_FW393\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/103154973-ec9ac100-479b-11eb-8428-16dbf746a0b9.jpg\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">Calibration point on the heatbed \"as seen\" by the printer</p>\r\n\r\nFrom the measured data, the printer now performs a subpixel processing of the scanned 32x32 bitmap and detects very precisely the center of each calibration point. More precise data of the printer's overall geometry (e.q. axis skew) helps the printer to apply appropriate adjustments resulting in a better print accuracy. Note that this new XYZ calibration requires more time (around 20-25 minutes) to scan and evaluate all the calibration points.\r\n\r\nThis new method also replaces the last step of the older process, where the exact center of each calibration point was iteratively searched using a cross-search technique. The previous “whole-pixel” search was providing an accuracy of about 0.6 mm. Now, it is less than 0.1 mm thanks to the sub-pixel analysis.\r\n\r\nPerforming this new XYZ calibration on a calibrated printer is not necessary unless you are experiencing issues with your prints. Note that 3D printers from the MK3 family recognize this new sensor automatically. However, in the case of MK2.5/MK2.5S, the user needs to toggle a switch in the settings menu (LCD Menu -> Settings -> HW settings -> SuperPINDA -> ON/OFF) to inform the printer that the SuperPINDA sensor is present as the printer cannot recognize it automatically."

These release notes include information provided in the previous release 3.9.1-RC1.\r\n\r\nBefore we dive into the detailed description, we would like to thank the entire Prusa community for the feedback, and our special thanks go to all active members, who helped us with this firmware release. Your input is very much appreciated!\r\n\r\nThis release required:\r\n- 350 different samples of print objects\r\n- 1500+ printing hours of the final tests\r\n- 20 pull requests\r\n- 95 commits\r\n- over 20 participating community members\r\n\r\n### Major improvements to LA15\r\nThe Linear Advance 1.5 (LA15) functionality was first introduced in the firmware release 3.9.0 and brought several improvements both to the print speed and quality. However, in certain scenarios, the algorithm didn't perform as expected during deceleration, leaving artifacts on specific geometries.\r\n\r\nThe issue was discovered in a bad timer check, which prevented fast LA ticks to be scheduled, effectively limiting LA as speed increased (such as in long stretch of perimeters or during infill) or with shorter intervals due to geared extruders (commit 173aa2d). This also combined with a bad sign check that would cause over-retraction as extrusion speed/nozzle size increased (commits c08f37d & fb5f09d).\r\n\r\nSeveral other tweaks were done to improve the print quality in specific scenarios and also to reduce CPU load allowing for better results with either high-resolution models or faster printing speeds. See PR #2785 for a detailed list.\r\n\r\nAfter several weeks of tests and hundreds of printed objects, it was clear that aside from fixing the above-mentioned issues, the K-factors also needed adjustments. This has affected not only the LA15 K-factors but also the “LA10 to LA15” conversion curve. Here are the most important changes:\r\n- The start K-factor is now K10 => K0.01 (the previous minimum was K15)\r\n- For PLA K30 => K0.05 (previously K=0.07, optimal range is 0.045-0.06)\r\n- For PETG K45 => K0.08 (previously K=0.13, optimal range* is 0.07-0.11)\r\n\r\n_*Based on the observations, the PETG optimal K-factor values depend greatly on the material composition (e.g. Prusament PETG differs from other PETG material) and also the temperature of the hotend/nozzle plays an important role. More information below._\r\n\r\nThe G-codes sliced in PrusaSlicer since March of 2020, might include K-factors for LA15, which are updated with this release. Therefore it is strongly recommended to update the G-codes from this time period. First, make sure you are running the latest PrusaSlicer and print profiles, then you have two options:\r\n- Use the original model (.stl. .3mf) and reslice it again.\r\n- Open the G-code in a text editor and change the values for M900.\r\n\r\n_Example of PETG:\r\nReplace all M900 K0.13 with MK900 K0.08_\r\n\r\nOlder G-codes with Linear Advance 1.0 (K-factors greater than 10) remain unaffected and will be converted correctly to the LA15 using the new conversion curve.\r\n\r\nThe results of our research can be seen in the two pictures below, the first with blue test objects is representing the PLA material with two different K-factors. Setting the K-factor too high can lead to missing material or distorted corners in certain geometries.\r\n\r\n![LA15_PLA_test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/93617097-d2e82180-f9d5-11ea-9f75-8c6821af9cbe.jpg)\r\n\r\nAn even stronger effect of the K-factor can be seen while experimenting with the PETG. The picture below shows the corners of four different boxes printed with individual K-factors. Even a relatively small numerical change (0.12 vs 0.08) can have a great effect on the final print quality.\r\n\r\n![LA15_PETG](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/93758508-dd3e3180-fc08-11ea-94b0-d67feb112560.jpg)\r\n\r\nWe will continue testing improving the LA15 and its capabilities and for most of the cases, the firmware together with the PrusaSlicer should provide correct parameters. Therefore no user calibration is needed.\r\n\r\nHowever, we can't test every available material on the market. In case you are using exotic material, or you are unsatisfied with the print results, we have created calibration patterns, which are used to help you select the most suitable K-factor for a given scenario. To learn more about the K-factor calibration, please visit our article at [help.prusa3d.com](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/linear-advance_2252).\r\n\r\n### Support for parts from selected vendors\r\nThe Covid-19 virus is negatively impacting worldwide supplies and in order to be able to ship the printers continuously without any significant delay, we have started to look for alternative verified suppliers of the most critical parts. This has an impact on the firmware, which must be capable of automatic detection and adjustments based on the used part.\r\n\r\nOne example is the hotend cooling fan, located on the side of the MK3S extruder. Because different fans from different manufacturers have their own specific speed (RPM) and airflow, starting with this release, the firmware is capable of adjusting the parameters using a technique called pulse-width modulation (PWM). This brings some challenges, which are explained below.\r\n\r\nFor a printer with stock parts, there are no visible changes to the firmware and no user interaction is needed. When a printer is run for the first time after the assembly, the firmware will automatically detect the fan and set appropriate PWM. This value is stored permanently in the EEPROM memory, stays the same after future firmware updates, and can be only deleted after performing a factory reset.\r\n\r\nFor modded community printers using different than stock fans, this firmware update will not change anything as stated in the previous paragraph. The only scenario, when the user has to intervene on the modded printer might be after the factory reset when the printer will try to recognize the fan and set the PWM, which might affect the fan's performance. For this scenario, we have prepared a solution in the form of a hidden service menu.\r\n\r\nTo turn the PWM off and run the fan on 100 % like in the previous firmware releases, go to LCD menu -> Settings -> HW Setup, then scroll to any menu item and hold the knob for 2-3 seconds. After a “click” sound, the display will flash once and the “service menu” will be opened, where you will see the option “Altfan detection” (Altfan det.) and you can toggle between ON/OFF. Note that setting a custom value of the PWM is currently not possible.\r\n\r\n### Ambient temperature check (MK3S/MK3)\r\nEvery Einsy board is equipped with an NTC thermistor, which is used to measure the surrounding ambient temperature. The sensor is located right above the main power connector at the bottom of the board. This release is introducing two error states, that can occur “AMBIENT_MINTEMP” and “AMBIENT_MAXTEMP”.\r\n\r\nThe “AMBIENT_MINTEMP” is used to check whether the thermistor works properly ensuring that the second “MAXTEMP” state will be triggered correctly. In a rare case, when this error is displayed, the printer will halt any operation and the Einsy board must be checked by a technician and possibly replaced. Don't operate the printer, until the problem is resolved.\r\n\r\nThe “AMBIENT_MAXTEMP” is set to 100 °C, if this temperature is reached, the printer will immediately cut power to the heaters and motors to reduce power draw. Resuming the print is not possible. The only allowed operation is resetting the printer, the user is also highly advised to inspect the board for problems before attempting to continue printing.\r\n\r\n### PC Blend preheat added\r\nThe list of preheat materials is now expanded with the polycarbonate Prusament PC Blend (“PC” in the menu). The default preheat values are 275 °C for the nozzle and 110 °C for the bed. To learn more about this material, [please visit our blog article](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/prusament-pc-blend-our-new-filament-for-highly-durable-3d-prints_33511/).\r\n\r\nSide note to Linear Advance 1.5, the optimal value for this firmware is currently K=0.07, for the previous releases (3.8.1 and 3.9.0) please use the PrusaSlicer profiles, where K=0.09.\r\n\r\n### Stack corruption fixed\r\nA bug has been discovered in the temperature and filament sensor interrupts that could unpredictably cause the return address to be corrupted and result in a system crash. The root of this issue seems to be the \"Static memory overwritten\" error messages randomly happening when stepping at high frequency (when ISR is preempted more frequently) and a number of other infrequent and hard-to-reproduce issues such as inexplicable extruder moves.\r\n\r\nSee PR #2791 for further details.\r\n\r\n### More precise Belt test (MK3S/MK3)\r\nThe Belt test was improved in the previous release 3.9.0 in order to make the measurement process more sensitive and detect any degradation of bearings and rods in the early stages. During the Belt test, the Trinamic stepper motors are supplied by lower current value in comparison with standard operation. The built-in StallGuard function (detecting the movement resistance by an increase of motor current) is, therefore, more sensitive.\r\n\r\nThis change to the sensitivity might lead to slightly different values measured by the printer compared to measurements done in the past. However, the range is the same as in the previous releases, your printer should be still within 240-300. If your printer measures value below 240, you should check the belt tension first. On an older printer with hundreds of hours of print time, this value indicates your rods and bearings need closer inspection and possibly maintenance.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to note that the test gives a recommendation, it won't disable any printing functions, even if the measured values are out of range. To learn more about the Belt test, please visit our article at [help.prusa3d.com](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/adjusting-belt-tension-mk3-s_112380). \r\n\r\n\r\n### Octoprint causing M112 fixed\r\nThe previous firmware versions sometimes incorrectly dropped some parts at the start of communication while connected over a serial line. This resulted in a scenario, where for example the Octoprint evaluated the printer as unavailable and sent G-code M112, which is a full emergency stop. More about the G-code M112 in our article at [help.prusa3d.com](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/prusa-specific-g-codes_112173).\r\n\r\nThis issue is now fixed and the printer communicates properly over the serial line."

However, in certain scenarios, the algorithm didn't perform as expected during deceleration, leaving artifacts on specific geometries.\r\n\r\nThe issue was discovered in a bad timer check, which prevented fast LA ticks to be scheduled, effectively limiting LA as speed increased (such as in long stretch of perimeters or during infill) or with shorter intervals due to geared extruders (commit 173aa2d). This also combined with a bad sign check that would cause over-retraction as extrusion speed/nozzle size increased (commits c08f37d & fb5f09d).\r\n\r\nSeveral other tweaks were done to improve the print quality in specific scenarios and also to reduce CPU load allowing for better results with either high-resolution models or faster printing speeds. See PR #2785 for a detailed list.\r\n\r\nThe changes to the algorithm will affect some K-factors in the final release. We are running multiple tests to set proper values. In the case of the PETG, the K-factor was initially set to K=0.12, however, with the adjusted algorithm optimal print results are currently achieved in a range K=0.07 to K=0.1 with dependency on the temperature. The higher the nozzle temperature for PETG, the lower the K-factor (e.g. 260 °C => K=0.07). For other materials like the PLA, the results so far show there is no need for change.\r\n\r\nNote that the K-factors are still in development. You can join us in the research by submitting your ideal K-factors with the new firmware 3.9.1-RC1. Once the final values are achieved, the conversion between LA10 and LA15 will be also updated. For the recently sliced G-codes with LA15, there is no need to reslice them, the K-factor can be adjusted manually using a text editor (search for M900 Kx.xx).\r\n\r\nWhile improving the LA15 we have printed multiple samples collected both from the community and our research lab, with the aim to surpass the print quality of both 3.9.0 running LA15 and 3.8.1 running LA10. We will continue pushing the capabilities of the LA15 in this and the upcoming releases.\r\n\r\n### Support for parts from selected vendors\r\nThe Covid-19 virus is negatively impacting worldwide supplies and in order to be able to ship the printers continuously without any significant delay, we have started to look for alternative verified suppliers of the most critical parts. This has an impact on the firmware, which must be capable of automatic detection and adjustments based on the used part.\r\n\r\nOne example is the hotend cooling fan, located on the side of the MK3S extruder. Because different fans from different manufacturers have their own specific speed (RPM) and airflow, starting with this release, the firmware is capable of adjusting the parameters using a technique called pulse-width modulation (PWM). This brings some challenges, which are explained below.\r\n\r\nFor a printer with stock parts, there are no visible changes to the firmware and no user interaction is needed. When a printer is run for the first time after the assembly, the firmware will automatically detect the fan and set appropriate PWM. This value is stored permanently in the EEPROM memory, stays the same after future firmware updates, and can be only deleted after performing a factory reset.\r\n\r\nFor modded community printers using different than stock fans, this firmware update will not change anything as stated in the previous paragraph. The only scenario, when the user has to intervene on the modded printer might be after the factory reset when the printer will try to recognize the fan and set the PWM, which might affect the fan's performance. For this scenario, we have prepared a solution in the form of a hidden service menu.\r\n\r\nTo turn the PWM off and run the fan on 100 % like in the previous firmware releases, go to LCD menu -> Settings -> HW Setup, then scroll to any menu item and hold the knob for 2-3 seconds. After a “click” sound, the display will flash once and the “service menu” will be opened, where you will see the option “Altfan detection” (Altfan det.) and you can toggle between ON/OFF. Note that setting a custom value of the PWM is currently not possible.\r\n\r\n### Ambient temperature check (MK3S/MK3)\r\nEvery Einsy board is equipped with an NTC thermistor, which is used to measure the surrounding ambient temperature. The sensor is located right above the main power connector at the bottom of the board. This release is introducing two error states, that can occur “AMBIENT_MINTEMP” and “AMBIENT_MAXTEMP”.\r\n\r\nThe “AMBIENT_MINTEMP” is used to check whether the thermistor works properly ensuring that the second “MAXTEMP” state will be triggered correctly. In a rare case, when this error is displayed, the printer will halt any operation and the Einsy board must be checked by a technician and possibly replaced. Don't operate the printer, until the problem is resolved.\r\n\r\nThe “AMBIENT_MAXTEMP” is set to 100 °C, if this temperature is reached, the printer will immediately cut power to the heaters and motors to reduce power draw. Resuming the print is not possible. The only allowed operation is resetting the printer, the user is also highly advised to inspect the board for problems before attempting to continue printing.\r\n\r\n### PC Blend preheat added\r\nThe list of preheat materials is now expanded with the polycarbonate Prusament PC Blend (“PC” in the menu). The default preheat values are 275 °C for the nozzle and 110 °C for the bed. To learn more about this material, [please visit our blog article](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/prusament-pc-blend-our-new-filament-for-highly-durable-3d-prints_33511/).\r\n\r\nSide note to Linear Advance 1.5, the optimal value for this firmware is currently K=0.07, for the previous releases (3.8.1 and 3.9.0) please use the PrusaSlicer profiles, where K=0.09.\r\n\r\n### Stack corruption fixed\r\nA bug has been discovered in the temperature and filament sensor interrupts that could unpredictably cause the return address to be corrupted and result in a system crash. The root of this issue seems to be the \"Static memory overwritten\" error messages randomly happening when stepping at high frequency (when ISR is preempted more frequently) and a number of other infrequent and hard-to-reproduce issues such as inexplicable extruder moves.\r\n\r\nSee PR #2791 for further details.\r\n\r\n### More precise Belt test (MK3S/MK3)\r\nThe Belt test was improved in the previous release 3.9.0 in order to make the measurement process more sensitive and detect any degradation of bearings and rods in the early stages. During the Belt test, the Trinamic stepper motors are supplied by lower current value in comparison with standard operation. The built-in StallGuard function (detecting the movement resistance by an increase of motor current) is, therefore, more sensitive.\r\n\r\nThis change to the sensitivity might lead to slightly different values measured by the printer compared to measurements done in the past. However, the range is the same as in the previous releases, your printer should be still within 240-300. If your printer measures value below 240, you should check the belt tension first. On an older printer with hundreds of hours of print time, this value indicates your rods and bearings need closer inspection and possibly maintenance.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to note that the test gives a recommendation, it won't disable any printing functions, even if the measured values are out of range. To learn more about the Belt test, please visit our article at [help.prusa3d.com](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/adjusting-belt-tension-mk3-s_112380). \r\n\r\n\r\n### Octoprint causing M112 fixed\r\nThe previous firmware versions sometimes incorrectly dropped some parts at the start of communication while connected over a serial line. This resulted in a scenario, where for example the Octoprint evaluated the printer as unavailable and sent G-code M112, which is a full emergency stop. More about the G-code M112 in our article at [help.prusa3d.com](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/prusa-specific-g-codes_112173).\r\n\r\nThis issue is now fixed and the printer communicates properly over the serial line."

Introducing new features, improved functionality, and bug fixes. These release notes are a summary of the previous releases *BETA*, *RC1*, *RC3*.\r\n\r\nThis release includes:\r\n- **409** commits to the code\r\n- **108** pull requests\r\n- **66** closed issues\r\n- cooperation of **14** developers\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to our community and the most active users @leptun, @wavexx, @3d-gussner, @nikkolade, @vintagepc @smurfix for discovering/reporting various issues and helping with fixing and testing them. Special thanks to @awenelo and @carlin57 for helping with the French translation. We really appreciate your cooperation.\r\n\r\n## Detailed description\r\n\r\n### Linear Advance 1.5\r\nOne of the biggest contributions from the community is the support for Linear Advance 1.5, which is also backward compatible with the previous version. In case you have a G-code with Linear Advance 1.0, the printer will analyze the code and convert the values automatically.\r\n\r\n![LA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45625875/72543817-92ecff80-3886-11ea-8437-445c55fa86a1.png)\r\n*<p align=\"center\">This graph is showing the function used for converting LA 1.0 and 1.5</p>*\r\n\r\nLinear Advance 1.5 (LA15) has been introduced in the *3.9.0-BETA* release and it was further improved in the *RC1* and *RC3* releases. One of the major fixes is addressing issue #2543 reported by user @nikkolade. The release *3.9.0-RC1* was causing print issues (mainly an inconsistency in quality) compared to the stable *3.8.1*.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this issue was in the implementation of the linear advance function. And while fixing it, the developers have discovered that it is partly present in the latest stable release *3.8.1* as well. Further research revealed that it is also responsible for rare scenarios, in which the material was missing at the start of a path of an object's support, which negatively affected the support quality.\r\n\r\nAnother problem was with the acceleration while using a factor **K=15**. With this value, the printing speeds were lowered significantly because after the conversion to the LA15, the K factor value was close to zero (3E-9) and the firmware responded incorrectly.\r\n\r\nLast addition to the Linear Advance 1.5 and PrusaSlicer profiles. To keep the profiles compatible with both FW *3.9.x+* and older firmware versions, this release accepts a G-code where the K factors are specified in pairs. The old firmware *3.8.1* picks up the last **M900 Kxx** (this will remain as the old Linear Advance 1.0 K factor value), while the new firmware *3.9.0* has a smarter algorithm. When the new FW encounters **M900 Kxx** with **xx < 10** it automatically switches to Linear Advance 1.5 mode, accepting only **xx < 10** from now on.\r\n\r\nHowever, if a custom filament profile is used and the user wants to update these to be compatible with new and old firmware, it is important that the **M900 Kx.xx** LA1.5 value MUST be placed BEFORE the **M900 Kyy** LA1.0 value.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the *FW3.9.0+* firmware will switch to LA1.0 conversion mode and ignore the 2nd **M900 Kx.xx** value as it **K is <10** and so invalid in this mode.\r\n\r\nExample of **K** factor in the G-code:\r\n```\r\nM900 K0.12\r\nM900 K45\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirmware 3.8.1 behavior:\r\n*The firmware will pick up the second (last) value (K45)*\r\nFirmware 3.9.0 behavior:\r\n*The firmware will use the first (LA15) value K0.12*\r\n\r\nTo make this compatible with MMU G-codes, which may set different K factors for different materials, **M900 K0** resets the Linear Advance mode.\r\n\r\nA new **M900 Kxx** with either new or old values may be accepted then and the firmware will act accordingly. In general, the **M900 K0** resets the LA and it is recommended to have it at the end of every G-code.\r\n\r\nA special note regarding the calibration prints created under LA 1.0. The automatic conversion to the LA 1.5 might not bring the same print results compared to the previous version. This is because the automatically converted K factors (LA 1.0 to LA 1.5) can differ from the ideal K factors for LA 1.5. It is highly recommended to reslice the calibration object having the LA 1.5 values already in the G-code.\r\n\r\nIn general, it is recommended that the user switches to the new profiles whenever possible. Even some community profiles are already LA 1.5 compatible and will produce better print results.\r\n\r\nFor custom profiles, starting this firmware there are three options:\r\n1) Use the new LA15 K values to achieve the best print results\r\n2) Use the old LA10 K values, which will be auto-converted to LA15\r\n3) Use both K values to create profile compatible with the old and new firmware\r\n\r\nAll the issues mentioned above are addressed in this release, the quality of the supports is now improved and the conversion function has been further tweaked to achieve optimal print results.\r\n\r\n### Automatic E-jerk conversion\r\nWith the introduction of Linear Advance 1.5 to the firmware, it was also necessary to convert the values of the E-jerk, originally used for Linear Advance 1.0. Based on internal testing, it was decided to set the conversion of the E-jerk parameter from **1.5** to **4.5**. If there is a different E-jerk value in the G-code file, the printer uses the function shown in the graph below to convert the value correctly.\r\n\r\n![LA15vs10_ejerk](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/74690103-0b284700-51de-11ea-9a6f-0257161e2abf.png)\r\n\r\nOld profiles with very low e-jerk might still result in a very slow print. Resetting the E-jerk to the standard values in the *\"Print Settings, Machine limits\"* menu will fix such an issue.\r\n\r\n### Screen brightness adjustment (MK3/MK3S)\r\nStarting this release, certain printer models are capable of adjusting the brightness of the screen, which is convenient if the printer is used in a darker environment. The user can adjust the following parameters:\r\n\r\n![ScreenBacklightON_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45625875/72566149-9ea2eb00-38b3-11ea-938d-3a602ffee00b.jpg)\r\n*<p align=\"center\">Screen Backlight ON</p>*\r\n\r\n![ScreenBacklightOFF_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45625875/72566244-c1cd9a80-38b3-11ea-9d61-216b49d2cdd6.jpg)\r\n*<p align=\"center\">Screen Backlight OFF</p>*\r\n\r\nIn the menu head to *Settings -> Brightness*\r\n\r\nThis feature is available for printers manufactured in the second half of 2019. For older printers, you have to replace the LCD screen and also in some cases the Einsy board (you must have Einsy 1.1a or newer). Selected parts can be obtained in the official e-shop, spare parts section.\r\n\r\n### Filament sensor recognition (MK3S)\r\nOver the lifetime of the MK3 and MK3S, we have introduced several iterations of the sensor responsible for filament checks. The MK3 was using a laser sensor, which was later replaced with another generation in the MK3S, which uses a steel ball and a lever-arm to trigger the sensor. In the latest iteration of the sensor with the red PCB introduced last year (2019), we have added one feature, which will be activated starting this release.\r\n\r\nThe printer will be able to recognize that the connection with the sensor was interrupted (e.g. broken wire or disconnected cable) and take appropriate action based on the settings in the *Menu > Settings > HW setup > FS action*\r\n\r\n1. **Pause** - pause the print, show an onscreen message and wait for the user\r\n2. **Continue** - ignore the issue and continue printing\r\n\r\nTo ensure correct operation, the printer needs to recognize the sensor first. As explained above, this will work only for the MK3S and only for the red PCB sensor, which is revision 0.4.\r\n\r\nRight now there are two options for the MK3S:\r\n1. The printer is equipped with the unsupported revision 0.3 or older\r\n2. The printer is equipped with the supported revision 0.4 or newer*\r\n*\\*Currently, there are no plans for another revision of the filament sensor.*\r\n\r\nThe process is fully automatic and the printer enables the new feature for the revision 0.4 only when all of the following conditions are met:\r\n1. The printer is in an idle state *(e.g. not printing, not heating up, …)*\r\n2. Only if the InfoScreen *(home screen)* is displayed\r\n3. The sensor state is either *“Unknown”* or *“Older version”*\r\n4. In the settings menu, the *Filament sensor* is set to *“ON”*\r\n5. The correct voltages were measured *(conditions: no filament: 4.2-4.6 V, inserted filament: 0.3-0.5 V)*\r\n\r\nAs soon as the new sensor is detected and the conditions are met, the printer will display the following message in the lowest row of the LCD screen: *“FS v0.4 or newer”*\r\n\r\nIn the *Support > Voltages* menu, a new value will now be displayed regardless of the version of the sensor: **“IR: x.xxV”**. This value represents the actual voltage measured on the pin of the filament sensor.\r\n\r\nIn the *Support > Fil. sensor* menu, information about the revision of the sensor will be displayed. Currently, three possible states are defined:\r\n1. 0.3 or older\r\n2. 0.4 or newer\r\n3. unknown status\r\n\r\nThere is a new submenu in *Settings > HW settings > Fsensor Detection*. Where the sensor revision recognition can be triggered manually for the MK3S printer, the MK3S with the MMU2S unit must run the Selftest.\r\n\r\nThe recognition process is as follows:\r\n\r\n![fsensor_schema](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45625875/80500123-1336fc80-896e-11ea-8c3a-ff8821bf4d22.png)\r\n\r\nNote that if the procedure fails at any point, it stops completely and has to be started again by the user.\r\n\r\nThe measured values of the voltages during the process can be read from the serial connection:\r\n- *“Measured filament sensor high level: xxx V”*\r\n- *“Measured filament sensor low level: xxx V”*\r\n\r\nIn a very rare scenario, in which the user decides to downgrade the 0.4 sensor to an older revision, it is necessary to run the procedure manually, to inform the printer about the change.\r\n\r\nA specific behavior is set after a factory reset is performed, which resets all the stored values including the filament sensor version. Upon the start there are two possible ways:\r\n\r\n1. The initial Wizard has been completed correctly. In this scenario, the filament sensor is checked and regardless of the version it is set \"0.3 or older\". If the printer has version 0.4 installed, it will be automatically changed later on as soon as the five conditions for starting the automatic detection explained above are met.\r\n\r\n2. The initial Wizard has been skipped. In this scenario, the printer is unable to make the initial check and therefore it stays in an *\"unknown state\"*. The user can run the verification process by doing the Selftest from the menu, which will have the same results as finishing the initial Wizard. An alternative option for the MK3S without the MMU2S unit is to run the *\"Fsensor Detection\"* directly and fully complete the recognition.\r\n\r\n*Attention for those using a printer with a modified filament sensor (i.e. with a LED). Since we are unable to test every possible modification to the original hardware, please verify the behavior is correct. In case of any issues, this detection algorithm can be disabled in the source code.*\r\n\r\n### New G-code files sorting\r\nUntil now, G-code files on the SD card were sorted based on the time when each file was created and the system was ignoring any modification to it. Another issue was discovered later on, while using only the “modification time” parameter for sorting the files.\r\n\r\nIf an old G-code file was copied to the SD card, it wasn't placed at the very top due to the sorting logic. This final release fixes all possible scenarios by checking both the *“modification”* and “creation time” parameters and selecting the most recent one.\r\n\r\n### Toggle and Translations\r\nThe code responsible for displaying the toggle menus was rewritten in order to enable faster switching and lower the requirements on the CPU. Toggle menus were previously hardcoded into the firmware, this is now changed to enable easier translations.\r\n\r\n### MMU2S selector blade activated\r\nPart of the MMU2S unit is a selector equipped with a blade, which if needed will cut the tip of the filament unloaded from the extruder. Until now the cutting function wasn't enabled.\r\n\r\nTo start using this function, make sure you have:\r\n- Firmware 1.0.6 installed in the MMU2S unit\r\n- Firmware 3.9.0 installed in the MK3S/MK2.5S\r\n\r\nThe printed parts for the selector (mmu2-blade-holder and mmu2-selector-finda) were updated to provide a better grip of the blade and are available for download [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.prusa3d.com/downloads/others/MK3orMK25toMMU2S_upgrade_stl.zip&sa=D&ust=1589808840577000&usg=AFQjCNH-GU8s4LmoQ0JotcitkufF2z3baA).\r\n\r\n### Show current Z offset in reset dialog before first layer calibration\r\nIn the case of rerunning the First Layer Calibration, the printer first checks if the value of Live Adjust Z is stored in the EEPROM. Before the process is started, the user is asked to confirm, whether the calibration should start from the current value of the Live Adjust Z or reset this value to zero (factory defaults).\r\n\r\n### Unknown Z coordinate displayed\r\nIn a situation when the printer doesn't know the exact Z-axis position (e.g. after the power on) a question mark is displayed on the screen next to the Z coordinate.\r\n\r\nThere was also an issue with displaying the *“?”* instead of the correct Z-axis coordinate caused by the behavior of the black Delta PSU. This is now fixed.\r\n\r\n### Safer moves in Z-axis, if the position is unknown (MK3/MK3S) #1768\r\nAdditionally, in a situation when the printer doesn't know the exact Z-axis position (e.g. after the power on) a stall guard is activated to stop the movement immediately if the obstacle (heatbed) is detected.\r\n\r\n### Language dictionary size increased\r\nThe original design of the memory blocks in the external FLASH expected files smaller than 64 KB. However, while increasing the number of functions and respective text strings, the size of some language dictionaries required a bigger space allocation. After successfully refactoring this part of the code, this limit is no longer present.\r\n\r\n### Heating disabled during MBL\r\nThe Pulse-width modulation (PWM) of the heated bed created an electromagnetic field, which had a negative impact on the P.I.N.D.A. sensor during the mesh bed levelling (MBL) procedure. To increase the reliability of the measurements, heating is temporarily disabled when the sensor is above each of the measured points during the MBL.\r\n\r\n### MINTEMP value lowered (MK3/MK3S)\r\nBased on the feedback from the community and internal testing, the minimal operational temperature was lowered from 15°C to 10°C (59°F to 50°F).\r\n\r\nNote that for the MK2.5 and MK2.5 the lowest allowed temperature is still 15°C as the readings below this value are inconsistent.\r\n\r\n### MINTEMP error differentiated\r\nPreviously the firmware displayed a message *“MINTEMP FIXED”* after a successful recovery in an environment with low temperature. New firmware distinguishes between *“MINTEMP HOTEND FIXED”* and *“MINTEMP BED FIXED”*.\r\n\r\n### Laser filament sensor sensitivity fix (MK3)\r\nThe sensitivity of the laser filament sensor on older MK3 printers was improved to be more reliable and prevent false filament runout detections with problematic filaments, such as **pink PLA** or transparent **green HG100**. Advanced statistics are now available in the sensor menu of MK3 printers.\r\n\r\n### Flickering “Statistics” screen fixed\r\nThe screen displaying the statistics was flickering during the print due to an error in the code responsible for refreshing the screen. The error is now fixed.\r\n\r\n### Tone timer re-enabled\r\nThe function responsible for the tone playback was broken in the previous release. It is now fixed and available at timer4 *(timer2 is used as a system_timer)* both for Einsy *(MK3S/MK3)* and MiniRambo *(MK2.5S/MK2.5)*.\r\n\r\n### Nozzle crash protection improved (MK3/MK3S)\r\nStarting this release, the firmware has the StallGuard functionality for the Z-axis enabled also during the self-test procedure. If the P.I.N.D.A. sensor is set too high and the nozzle starts crashing into the heatbed, the StallGuard is activated and motion of the Z-axis immediately stopped to prevent any possible damage. A warning message *“Bed leveling failed. The sensor didn't trigger. Debris on nozzle? Waiting for reset.”* is then displayed on the screen.\r\n\r\nNote, that this function is available only on the boards with the Trinamic drivers (MK3/MK3S). Older printers like MK2.5 and MK2.5S won't support it.\r\n\r\n### MMU runout for unknown filament fixed\r\nThis fix addresses the issue with the printer soft-resetting in case a filament runout is detected while the current filament is unknown. This can happen due to the following reasons:\r\n- User performed a load to the nozzle and an event caused a power cycle (power panic during MMU print)\r\n- User turned off the printer and continued printing with the same filament the next day\r\n\r\nSince the currently loaded filament is unknown, the printer cannot reliably retract it and move the selector to the next one if the SpoolJoin function is enabled, nor can it be marked as fully depleted. After trying several automatic procedures, it was decided to trigger M600 in such scenarios and require the user's attention to verify the state of the filament.\r\n\r\nThis fixes issues #2464, #1993, #2301, #2500, and kudos to user @vintagepc for his contribution!\r\n\r\n### Belt test improvements (MK3/MK3S)\r\nThe belt test feature is providing approximate values indicating, whether the belts are properly tensioned. There were some scenarios, in which the test didn't finish correctly.\r\n\r\nThis release fixes all of them, namely: #2472, #2356, #2484, #968, #2547 and again kudos to @vintagepc.\r\n\r\nAlso, until now the status was refreshed only after running the Selftest. Based on the feedback from the community it is now as a standalone test available at all times. To run it, go to the *Menu->Support->Belt status* ( #1060 #1937).\r\n\r\n### Decoupling XYZ relative and E relative\r\nUntil now the Prusa-Firmware was preventing the user from using relative XYZ motion (for Z-hop) at the same time with absolute extrusion. This behavior was fixed and also switched at the same time to be more inline with the Marlin 2.0 standard (changing the XYZ relativity also affects the extruder).\r\n\r\nThe users however reported that some calibration G-codes stopped working with the RC1 release. It turns out those G-codes needed the axis to be decoupled just like previously in Prusa-Firmware and not be directly inline with Marlin 2.0. The second change, which came with RC2, which decoupled the XYZ relativity from the extruder completely, eliminating both mentioned issues simultaneously.\r\n\r\n## Other changes\r\n### Sheet's name displayed on the status screen\r\n#2146 #2093\r\n\r\nThe name of the currently selected steel sheet is now displayed on the home screen for a better overview (if two or more sheets are calibrated).\r\n\r\n### Enable print fan to speed up while “waiting for a cooldown” procedure\r\n#1704\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the hotend to cool down, the printer activates the print fan in order to speed up the cooling phase.\r\n\r\n### M350 for all axes\r\n#2057\r\nThe G-code M350 (micro-stepping) is now implemented for all axes, previously only for the extruder.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n### Heater running and extruder not parked at print's end\r\nIn some scenarios at the end of the print, the heater was still running and the extruder wasn't parked at the correct location.\r\n\r\n### F.I.N.D.A. sensor always triggered\r\nThe F.I.N.D.A. sensor on some MMU2S units was always triggered, even if no filament was present.\r\n\r\n### Infinite Loop\r\nG-code M601 was in specific scenarios causing an endless loop.\r\n\r\n### Fixed planner for Octoprint MMU2S power panic improved\r\nFixed planner for Octoprint MMU2S after a power panic, which caused incorrect reconnection to the printed object.\r\n\r\n### Filament runout\r\nThe filament runout for MMU2S doesn't work properly.\r\n\r\n### Stop print\r\nStop print during print with MMU2S causes a filament runout.\r\n\r\n## GitHub templates\r\nWe have improved the procedure while creating an issue on the GitHub, the page is now equipped with several templates to address all possible issues.\r\n\r\n- BUG\r\n- ENHANCEMENT\r\n- FEATURE REQUEST\r\n- QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nWhile starting a new issue please take your time, select and fill in the most appropriate one. It will speed up the entire process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Version **3.9.0-RC2** is a non-public release because of a bug discovered after the final build of RC2 was created.\r\n\r\n## Detailed description\r\n### More improvements to LA15\r\nLinear Advance 1.5 (LA15) has been further improved for this release. One of the major fixes is addressing issue #2543 reported by user @nikkolade. The previous release 3.9.0-RC1 was causing print issues (mainly an inconsistency in quality) compared to the stable 3.8.1.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this issue was in the implementation of the linear advance function. And while fixing it, the developers have discovered that it is partly present in the latest stable release 3.8.1 as well. Further research revealed that it is also responsible for rare scenarios, in which the material was missing at the start of a path of an object's support, which negatively affected the support quality.\r\n\r\nAnother problem was with the acceleration while using a factor **K=15**. At this value, the printing speeds were lowered significantly because after the conversion to the LA15, the K factor value was close to zero (3E-9) and the firmware responded incorrectly.\r\n\r\nAll the issues mentioned above are addressed in this release, the quality of supports is now improved and we have further tweaked the conversion function to achieve optimal print results. Kudos to users @nikkolade, @vintagepc @leptun @wavexx for either discovering/reporting the issue or helping fixing and testing it. We really appreciate their cooperation!\r\n\r\n### Nozzle crash protection improved (MK3/MK3S)\r\nStarting this release, the firmware has the StallGuard functionality for the Z-axis enabled also during the self-test procedure. If the P.I.N.D.A. sensor is set too high and the nozzle starts crashing into the heatbed, the StallGuard is activated and motion of the Z-axis immediately stopped to prevent any possible damage. A warning message “Bed leveling failed. Sensor didnt trigger. Debris on nozzle? Waiting for reset.” is then displayed on the screen.\r\n\r\nNote, that this function is available only on the boards with the Trinamic drivers (MK3/MK3S). Older printers like MK2.5 and MK2.5S won't support it.\r\n\r\n### Filament sensor recognition (MK3S only)\r\nOver the lifetime of the MK3 and MK3S, we have introduced several iterations of the sensor responsible for filament checks. The MK3 was using an optical sensor, which was later replaced with another generation in the MK3S, which uses a steel ball and a lever-arm to trigger the sensor. In the latest iteration of the sensor with the red PCB introduced last year (2019), we have added one feature, which will be activated starting this release. The printer will be able to recognize that the connection with the sensor was interrupted (e.g. broken wire or disconnected cable), pause the print and inform the user.\r\n\r\nTo ensure correct operation, the printer needs to recognize the sensor first. As explained above, this will work only for the MK3S and only for the red PCB sensor, which is revision 0.4.\r\n\r\nRight now there are two options for the MK3S:\r\n1. The printer is equipped with the unsupported revision 0.3 or older\r\n2. The printer is equipped with the supported revision 0.4 or newer*\r\n\r\n_*Currently, there are no plans for another revision of the filament sensor._\r\n\r\nThe process is fully automatic and the printer enables the new feature for the revision 0.4 only when all of the following conditions are met:\r\n1. The printer is in an idle state (e.g. not printing, not heating up, …)\r\n2. Only if the InfoScreen (home screen) is displayed\r\n3. The sensor state is either “Unknown” or “Older version”\r\n4. In the settings menu, the Filament sensor is set to “ON”\r\n5. The correct voltage was measured (conditions: no filament: 4.2-4.6 V, inserted filament: 0.3-0.5 V)\r\n\r\nAs soon as the new sensor is detected and the conditions are met, the printer will display the following message in the lowest row of the LCD screen: _“FS v0.4 or newer”_\r\n\r\nIn the _“Support -> Voltages”_ menu, a new value will now be displayed regardless of the version of the sensor: _“IR: x.xxV”_. This value represents the actual voltage measured on the pin of the filament sensor.\r\n\r\nIn the _“Support -> Fil. sensor”_ menu, information about the revision of the sensor will be displayed. Currently, three possible states are defined:\r\n1. 0.3 or older\r\n2. 0.4 or newer \r\n3. unknown status\r\n\r\nThere is a new submenu in _“Settings -> HW settings -> Fsensor Detection”_. Where the sensor revision recognition can be triggered manually.\r\n\r\nThe recognition process is as follows:\r\n![fsensor_schema](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45625875/80500123-1336fc80-896e-11ea-8c3a-ff8821bf4d22.png)\r\n\r\nThe measured values of the voltages during the process can be read from the serial connection: \r\n- _“Measured filament sensor high level: xxx V”_\r\n- _“Measured filament sensor low level: xxx V”_\r\n\r\nIn a very rare scenario, in which the user decides to downgrade the 0.4 sensor to an older revision, it is necessary to run the procedure manually, to inform the printer about the change.\r\n\r\n**A known issue:**\r\nIn case the full factory reset is performed _“Factory reset -> “All Data”_ the printer will lose track of which sensor version is currently connected. The automatic recognition mechanism doesn’t work for this specific scenario and the recognition must be started manually through the menu _\"Settings -> HW Setup -> Fsensor Detection\"_. This will be fixed in the final release of this firmware 3.9.0.\r\n\r\n_Attention for those using a printer with a modified filament sensor (i.e. with a LED). Since we are unable to test every possible modification to the original hardware, please verify the behavior is correct. In case of any issues, this detection algorithm can be disabled in the source code._\r\n\r\n### File sorting updated\r\nPreviously, the firmware was using only the “modification time” parameter for sorting the files. However, if an old G-code was copied to the SD card, it wasn't placed at the very top due to the sorting logic. This release fixes this scenario by checking both the “modification” and “creation time” parameters and selecting the most recent one.\r\n\r\n### MMU runout for unknown filament fixed\r\nThis fix addresses the issue with the printer soft-resetting in case a filament runout is detected while the current filament is unknown. This can happen due to the following reasons:\r\n- User performed a load to the nozzle and an event caused a power cycle (power panic during MMU print)\r\n- User turned off the printer and continued printing with the same filament the next day\r\n\r\nSince the currently loaded filament is unknown, the printer cannot reliably retract it and move the selector to the next one if the Spooljoin function is enabled, nor can it be marked as fully depleted. After trying several automatic procedures, it was decided to trigger M600 in such scenarios and require the user's attention to verify the state of the filament.\r\n\r\nThis fixes issues #2464, #1993, #2301, #2500, and kudos to user @vintagepc for his contribution!\r\n\r\n### Belt test improvements\r\nThe belt test feature is providing approximate values indicating, whether the belts are properly tensioned. There were some scenarios, in which the test didn't finish correctly.\r\n\r\nThis release fixes all of them, namely: #2472, #2356, #2484, #968, #2547 and again kudos to @vintagepc.\r\n\r\n### Decoupling XYZ relative and E relative\r\nUntil now the Prusa-Firmware was preventing the user from using relative XYZ motion (for Z-hop) at the same time with absolute extrusion. This behavior was fixed and also switched at the same time to be more inline with the Marlin 2.0 standard (changing the XYZ relativity also affects the extruder).\r\n\r\nThe users however reported that some calibration G-codes stopped working with the RC1 release. It turns out those G-codes needed the axis to be decoupled just like previously in Prusa-Firmware and not be directly inline with Marlin 2.0. The second change, which comes with this RC2, decouples the XYZ relativity from the extruder completely, eliminating both mentioned issues simultaneously.\r\n\r\n### Calling out all the brave testers\r\nWe would like to release the final firmware as soon as possible, however, there are over 130 pull requests between version 3.8.1-FINAL and the current 3.9.0-RC3. Some of them like Linear Advance 1.5 are a major change to the printer's behaviour and we want to be sure that the final version is as stable as the current version 3.8.1.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to release the final version of the 3.9.0 in about two weeks, if no major issues are discovered. We would appreciate feedback from the community. Compare your prints between both firmware versions and let us know if the quality is the same or better on the newer firmware.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that LA1.5 is less demanding on the CPU than the LA1.0, therefore the prints might finish slightly sooner. The limiting factor is now the value of the E-jerk which is now set to a rather conservative value of 4.5. If your G-code has a LA1.0 with value 1.5 it will be automatically converted to value 4.5. We are currently testing an E-jerk value of 8, which is still relatively safe and won't cause the Extruder motor to skip steps.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to collect the community experience and tweak the firmware to achieve even faster printing times. \r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n"

This issue is now fixed. Also, during the debugging, the developers discovered a way to further optimize the code. This release corrects an issue with data being reset on “Fail stats > Last print” and also fixes a scenario in which the printer would fail to heat up the hotend during the recovery. This caused an issue when the printed object could detach from the sheet as the extruder moved.\r\n\r\n### Automatic E-jerk conversion\r\nWith the introduction of Linear Advance 1.5 to the firmware, it was also necessary to convert the values of the E-jerk, originally used for Linear Advance 1.0. Based on internal testing, it was decided to set the conversion of the E-jerk parameter from 1.5 to 4.5. If there is a different E-jerk value in the G-code file, the printer uses the function shown in the graph below to convert the value correctly.\r\n\r\n![LA15vs10_ejerk](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/74690103-0b284700-51de-11ea-9a6f-0257161e2abf.png)\r\n\r\n### Heating disabled during MBL\r\nThe Pulse-width modulation (PWM) of the heated bed created an electromagnetic field, which had a negative impact on the P.I.N.D.A. sensor during the mesh bed levelling (MBL) procedure. To increase the reliability of the measurements, heating is temporarily disabled above each measured point during the MBL.\r\n\r\n### MINTEMP value lowered\r\nBased on the feedback from the community, the minimal operational temperature was lowered from 15°C to 10°C (59°F to 50°F). \r\n\r\n### MINTEMP error differentiated\r\nPreviously the firmware displayed a message “MINTEMP FIXED” after a successful recovery in an environment with low temperature. New firmware distinguishes between “MINTEMP HOTEND FIXED” and “MINTEMP BED FIXED”.\r\n\r\n### Filament sensor sensitivity fix (MK3)\r\nThe new Linear Advance 1.5 function was causing issues on older MK3 printers equipped with the IR filament sensor. The sensitivity of the sensor was adjusted to prevent false filament runout detections. Most problematic colours were pink and transparent green filament.\r\n\r\n### Flickering “Statistics” screen fixed\r\nThe screen displaying the statistics was flickering during the print due to an error in the code responsible for refreshing the screen. The error is now fixed.\r\n\r\n### Tone timer re-enabled\r\nThe function responsible for the tone playback was broken in the previous release. It is now fixed and available at timer4 (timer2 is used as a system_timer) both for Einsy (MK3S) and MiniRambo (MK2.5S).\r\n\r\n### “Unknown height” displayed for Z-axis fixed\r\nThere were several reports that the printer would display “?” instead of the Z coordinate. This happens, when the printer isn't sure about the exact position (height) of the Z-axis. The issue was caused by the behaviour of the black Delta PSU. This is now fixed.\r\n\r\n"

If you are experiencing frequent power surges, please consider waiting for the next release.**\r\n\r\n## Detailed description\r\nThis firmware release is focused mainly on pull requests from the community. Since there are many changes, we have decided to release the firmware in the BETA version. **Note that at this stage it is not recommended to use the firmware on a production printer!**\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank everyone, who participated in this release!\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n### Linear Advance 1.5\r\nhttps://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/1909\r\nOne of the biggest contributions from the community is the support for Linear Advance 1.5, which is also backward compatible with the previous version. In case you have a G-code with Linear Advance 1.0, the printer will analyze the code and convert the values.\r\n![LA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45625875/72543817-92ecff80-3886-11ea-8437-445c55fa86a1.png)\r\n*<p align=\"center\">This graph is showing the function used for converting LA 1.0 and 1.5</p>*\r\n\r\n### Screen brightness adjustment (MK3/MK3S only)\r\nStarting this release the selected printers are capable of adjusting the brightness of the screen, which is convenient if the printer is used in a darker environment. The user can adjust the following parameters:\r\n\r\n![ScreenBacklightON_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45625875/72566149-9ea2eb00-38b3-11ea-938d-3a602ffee00b.jpg)\r\n*<p align=\"center\">Screen Backlight ON</p>*\r\n\r\n![ScreenBacklightOFF_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45625875/72566244-c1cd9a80-38b3-11ea-9d61-216b49d2cdd6.jpg)\r\n*<p align=\"center\">Screen Backlight OFF</p>*\r\n\r\nIn the menu head to *Settings -> Brightness*\r\n\r\nUpdate: Note that this feature is available for printers manufactured in the second half of 2019. For older printers, you have to replace the LCD screen and also in some cases the Einsy board (you must have Einsy 1.1a or newer). Selected parts can be obtained in the e-shop, spare parts section.\r\n\r\n### Filament sensor status detection\r\nThis is feature is still in development and the goal is a better recognition of the filament sensor status. The printer is continuously measuring the voltage (*Support > Voltages*) and based on the value it recognizes three states:\r\n- Inserted filament: approx. 0.3 V - 0.5 V\r\n- No filament: approx. 4.2 V - 4.6 V\r\n- Disconnected sensor: approx. 4.8 V - 5.0 V\r\n\r\nThe sensor has to be at least version rev0.4 (red PCB).\r\n\r\n### New G-codes sorting (last modified)\r\nUntil now the G-codes on the SD card were sorted based on the time when each file was created and the system was ignoring any modification to it. Starting with 3.9.0-beta the files are sorted properly according to the last modification.\r\n\r\n### MK3 Toggle and Translations\r\nThe code responsible for displaying the toggle menus was rewritten in order to enable faster switching and lower the requirements on the CPU. Toggle menus were previously hardwired into the firmware, this is now changed to enable easier translations.\r\n\r\n### MMU2S selector blade activated\r\nPart of the MMU2S unit is a selector equipped with a blade, which if needed will cut the tip of the filament unloaded from the extruder. Until now the cutting function wasn't enabled.\r\n\r\nTo start using this function, make sure you have:\r\n- Firmware 1.0.6 installed in the MMU2S unit\r\n- Firmware 3.9.0-beta installed in the MK3S/MK2.5S\r\n\r\nThe printed parts for the selector were updated to provide a better grip of the blade and will be available for download soon.\r\n\r\n### Show current Z offset in reset dialog before first layer calibration\r\nIn the case of rerunning the First Layer Calibration, the printer first checks if the value of Live Adjust Z is stored in the EEPROM. Before the process is started, the user is asked to confirm, whether the calibration should start from the current value of the Live Adjust Z or reset this value to zero (factory defaults).\r\n\r\n### Independent belt test\r\nhttps://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/1060 https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/1937\r\nThe belt test is evaluating if proper tension in the belts is achieved and until now the status was refreshed only after running the self-test. Based on the feedback from the community it is now as a standalone test available at all times. To run it, go to the Menu->Support->Belt status.\r\n\r\n### Unknown Z\r\nIn a situation when the printer doesn't know the exact Z-axis position (e.g. after the power on) a question mark is displayed on the screen next to the Z coordinate.\r\n\r\n### Language dictionary size increased\r\nThe original design of the memory blocks in the EEPROM expected files smaller than 64 KB. However, while increasing the number of functions and respective text strings, the size of some language dictionaries required a bigger space allocation. After successfully refactoring this part of the code, this limit is no longer present.\r\n\r\n## Other changes\r\n### Sheet's name displayed on the status screen\r\nhttps://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/2146 https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/2093\r\nThe name of the currently selected steel sheet is now displayed on the home screen for easier orientation.\r\n\r\n### Enable print fan to speed up while “waiting for a cooldown” procedure\r\nhttps://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/1704\r\nWhile waiting for a hotend cooldown, the printer activates the print fan in order to speed up the cooling phase.\r\n\r\n### Safer moves in Z-axis, if the position is unknown\r\nhttps://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/1768\r\nIn a situation when the printer doesn't know the exact Z-axis position (e.g. after the power on) a stall guard is activated to stop the movement immediately if the obstacle (heatbed) is detected.\r\n\r\n### M350 for all axes\r\nhttps://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/pull/2057\r\nThe G-code M350 (micro-stepping) is now implemented for all axis, previously only for the extruder.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n### Heater running and extruder not parked at print's end\r\nIn some scenarios at the end of the print, the heater was still running and the extruder wasn't parked at the correct location.\r\n\r\n### F.I.N.D.A. sensor always triggered\r\nThe F.I.N.D.A. sensor on some MMU2S units was always triggered, even if no filament was present.\r\n\r\n### Infinite Loop\r\nG-code M601 was in specific scenarios causing an endless loop.\r\n\r\n### Fixed planner for OctoprintMMU2S power panic improved\r\nFixed planner for Octoprint MMU2S after a power panic, which caused incorrect reconnection to the printed object.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n### Power panic\r\nPower panic - as noted in the beginning the power panic function isn't working in this release.\r\n\r\n### Filament sensor for MK3\r\nThe optical sensor isn't detecting the filament correctly at all times.\r\n\r\n### Linear Advance e-jerk value\r\nThe conversion function between LA 1.5 and 1.0 doesn't refresh e-jerk value. As a result, the print might be up to 30&nbsp;% slower.\r\n\r\n### Filament runout\r\nThe filament runout for MMU2S doesn't work properly.\r\n\r\n### Stop print\r\nStop print during print with MMU2S causes a filament runout.\r\n\r\n## GitHub templates\r\nWe have improved the procedure while creating an issue on the GitHub, the page is now equipped with several templates to address all possible issues.\r\n\r\n- BUG\r\n- ENHANCEMENT\r\n- FEATURE REQUEST\r\n- QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nWhile starting a new issue please take your time, select and fill in the most appropriate one. It will speed up the entire process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

However, the textured and smooth PEI sheets perform better (improved filament adhesion), if the calibration is done based on the used material. Starting this release user can choose from the following expanded material list: PLA, PET, ASA, ABS, HIPS, PP, FLEX. #2117 This feature was also requested by the Prusa community and we would like to thank you for the valuable feedback.\r\n\r\n### Repeated First layer calibration settings\r\nIn case the First Layer Calibration is started again, the printer always used the previously saved value of Z-offset. This can cause an issue if the recalibration is done while changing the thinner textured for the thicker smooth sheet and thus the nozzle might be too low.\r\n\r\nWith the firmware 3.8.1 RC1, the printer always asks, whether to continue with the previously saved value or reset the offset to zero. #2222 \r\n\r\n### Fan error on Octoprint\r\nIf a _Fan error_ occurred during the print using an Octoprint, then the user was unable to continue with the print even if the issue was resolved. This is now fixed and the print can be restored.\r\n\r\n### Incorrect mode display MK2.5S & MK2.5\r\nIn some scenarios, after the printer reset, an incorrect _Mode_ was displayed (_High Power_ instead of _Stealth_). This bug is now fixed and the mode is displayed correctly.\r\n\r\n### New Live Adjust Z shortcut\r\nRight after the mesh bed levelling as soon as the print is started, the user can adjust from the menu the height between the tip of the nozzle and the steel sheet (_Live Adjust Z_) to ensure the filament is properly squished in the printing surface.\r\n\r\nNow, there is a new shortcut to access this function. Long press the rotation knob to enter the adjustment menu. The function is available only during the print between _0-2 mm_ of height.\r\n\r\nThe Live Adjust Z shortcut is allowed in the following menus (during the print only):\r\n- Info screen \r\n- Main menu\r\n- Tune \r\n- Support \r\n\r\n### Move Z shortcut adjustment\r\nTo move the Z-axis up or down, the user can either choose this option from the menu or long-press the rotation knob. Because this shortcut is now shared with the _Live Adjust Z_, the _Move Z_ is available only before the mesh bed leveling starts and after the print is finished.\r\n\r\nPreviously, it was also possible to use the shortcut during the print, this is now disabled. #2165 #2101 \r\n\r\nThe Move Z shortcut is allowed in the following menus:\r\n- Info screen \r\n- Main menu\r\n- Preheat \r\n- Print from SD \r\n- Settings \r\n- Temperature \r\n- Select language \r\n- Support \r\n\r\n### Translations corrections\r\nFor this release, the firmware, which is translated into seven languages, was checked by Prusa in-house native speakers improving the consistency with English original, 3D printing terminology and readability on the printer's screen.\r\n\r\n### Other bug fixes\r\nCalibration of the Z-axis wasn't working properly for the Stealth mode, now the calibration is always performed in the Normal Mode.\r\n"

However, the textured and smooth PEI sheets perform better (improved filament adhesion), if the calibration is done based on the used material. Starting this release user can choose from the following expanded material list: PLA, PET, ASA, ABS, HIPS, PP, FLEX. #2117 This feature was also requested by the Prusa community and we would like to thank you for the valuable feedback.\r\n\r\n### Repeated First layer calibration settings\r\nIn case the First Layer Calibration is started again, the printer always used the previously saved value of Z-offset. This can cause an issue if the recalibration is done while changing the thinner textured for the thicker smooth sheet and thus the nozzle might be too low.\r\n\r\nWith the firmware 3.8.1 RC1, the printer always asks, whether to continue with the previously saved value or reset the offset to zero. #2222 \r\n\r\n### Fan error on Octoprint\r\nIf a _Fan error_ occurred during the print using an Octoprint, then the user was unable to continue with the print even if the issue was resolved. This is now fixed and the print can be restored.\r\n\r\n### Incorrect mode display MK2.5S & MK2.5\r\nIn some scenarios, after the printer reset, an incorrect _Mode_ was displayed (_High Power_ instead of _Stealth_). This bug is now fixed and the mode is displayed correctly.\r\n\r\n### New Live Adjust Z shortcut\r\nRight after the mesh bed levelling as soon as the print is started, the user can adjust from the menu the height between the tip of the nozzle and the steel sheet (_Live Adjust Z_) to ensure the filament is properly squished in the printing surface.\r\n\r\nNow, there is a new shortcut to access this function. Long press the rotation knob to enter the adjustment menu. The function is available only during the print between _0-2 mm_ of height.\r\n\r\nThe Live Adjust Z shortcut is allowed in the following menus (during the print only):\r\n- Info screen \r\n- Main menu\r\n- Tune \r\n- Support \r\n\r\n### Move Z shortcut adjustment\r\nTo move the Z-axis up or down, the user can either choose this option from the menu or long-press the rotation knob. Because this shortcut is now shared with the _Live Adjust Z_, the _Move Z_ is available only before the mesh bed leveling starts and after the print is finished.\r\n\r\nPreviously, it was also possible to use the shortcut during the print, this is now disabled. #2165 #2101 \r\n\r\nThe Move Z shortcut is allowed in the following menus:\r\n- Info screen \r\n- Main menu\r\n- Preheat \r\n- Print from SD \r\n- Settings \r\n- Temperature \r\n- Select language \r\n- Support \r\n\r\n### Translations corrections\r\nFor this release, the firmware, which is translated into seven languages, was checked by Prusa in-house native speakers improving the consistency with English original, 3D printing terminology and readability on the printer's screen.\r\n"

However, due to a different thickness of various sheets (textured vs smooth PEI), each sheet requires individual First layer calibration. Starting with this release, we are adding a feature, which will store the settings for up to 8 sheets. You can then easily switch between the sheets (profiles) and the printer will load the stored values.\r\n\r\nThere is a new section of the settings menu called “HW setup”, which will allow you to individually setup each sheet and some other parameters, which are described later in this release log. \r\n\r\nTo set up the individual sheet profiles, please head to the *Settings -> HW setup -> Steel Sheets* (Fig. 1)\r\n\r\n\r\n![hw_setup_detail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/64450854-3f51f480-d0e3-11e9-8e20-04eb87235f15.jpg)\r\nFig. 1\r\n\r\nThere are currently eight sheet profiles (Fig. 2) available with predefined, but fully customizable names. Note that each sheet has the same factory settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n![sheets](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/64450671-f13cf100-d0e2-11e9-9e3e-b03e3d5b0a38.jpg)\r\nFig. 2\r\n\r\nFor each sheet you can do the following:\r\n1) *Select* - confirms the selection of the sheet, which will then become the default \r\n2) *First layer calibration* - takes you through the first layer calibration process, this calibration must be performed on each sheet (Fig. 3)\r\n3) *Rename* - enables you to change the name, up to seven characters (Fig. 4)\r\n4) *Reset* - sets the values back to the factory defaults\r\n\r\n![sheet_detail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/64450757-16316400-d0e3-11e9-9765-43bb33d39d05.jpg)\r\nFig. 3\r\n\r\n![rename](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/64450786-234e5300-d0e3-11e9-9a80-717eb4d44912.jpg)\r\nFig. 4\r\n\r\nAs soon as two or more profiles are configured, you will be able to quick-toggle between them directly from the main menu (Fig. 5)\r\n\r\n![sheet_change](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31956337/64450797-2b0df780-d0e3-11e9-9854-50036d1ac9bf.jpg)\r\nFig. 5\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading firmware to version 3.8.0, the existing Z offset value from First Layer Calibration is copied to the first steel sheet.\r\n\r\n### Nozzle diameter setup\r\nThis an initial release of this function. We need to finish the coding on the PrusaSlicer side in order to fully enable it. By default, all Original Prusa i3 printers are shipped with the 0.4mm nozzle. In case you change the nozzle, you can set the correct diameter in the printer's menu (see *Settings -> HW setup -> Nozzle d.*). The printer will then compare the stored value of the nozzle diameter with parametres in the G-code. If there is a mismatch, you will be informed to prevent a print failure.\r\n\r\n### Preliminary checks\r\nSimilarly to the previous feature, this one also requires an update of the PrusaSlicer. Once this is done, the printer will check multiple parameters in order to warn you about incompatible print settings. Before a print is started, the printer will compare parameters stored in the memory with the G-code. Checked values are nozzle diameter, the model of the printer and firmware version. Checks can be adjusted in *Settings -> Checks*.\r\n\r\nFor each controlled parameter, users can set three levels of warnings: \r\n*none* - check is turned off, the user won't receive any notification\r\n*warn* - a warning message will be displayed on the screen, user can continue with the print\r\n*strict* - a warning message will be displayed on the screen, the user can't continue until the issue is fixed, print is aborted\r\n\r\n### Firmware onscreen notification\r\nThe firmware onscreen notification about the availability of the new version no longer waits for the user response, which prevents the print from starting. The timeout is now set to 30 seconds, the printer then proceeds with the print.\r\n\r\n### Revised sound warnings\r\nIn the previous firmware release, there was an option to disable sound warnings completely by choosing the *[None]* option. Due to safety reasons, this release no longer offers this value. User can choose between *[Loud|Once|Silent|Assist]*, where the last value is newly introduced for visually impaired users.\r\n\r\nBy selecting the Assist sound mode, the printer enables accessibility feature and plays a different sound while scrolling through the menu and at the end of the menu.\r\n\r\n### Heatbed noise at 110 V (60 Hz)\r\nThere were several reports regarding noise from the heatbed when the printer was connected to a 110 V (60 Hz) network. In the current release, the rising and falling edges of the pulse-width modulation (PWM) are adjusted to fix the unwanted noise. Previously, the PWM was falling from 30 Hz to 15 Hz and as a result, the PSU started to switch between high and low power mode, which caused the \"clicking\". Also, while printing at extremely high speeds over a USB connection, the altered PWM affected the planner, resulting in a slower print. This is now fixed as well.\r\n\r\n### Crash detection fixes\r\nThe crash detection feature can be turned off in the printer's menu, however, in the RC1 release, it stopped working for the Normal mode. Even when set to [OFF], the printer still detected the crash (issue #2094). The part responsible for crash detection was revised and fixed.\r\n\r\nIn very rare cases, prior to the printing phase, a false crash was detected and then while printing the first layer the printer skipped some longer segments of the G-code (above 30 mm). As a result, the extruder moved according to the next G-code instruction. We've adjusted the behaviour of the crash detection for the first layer, which solved this issue.\r\n\r\n### Addition of the ASA material\r\nASA is newly introduced to the Original Prusa i3 printers and can be considered a true successor to ABS. Starting this release, ASA is included in the preheat menu with support in the PrusaSlicer. Learn more about ASA in our latest article [ASA Prusament is here!](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/asa-prusament-is-here-learn-everything-about-the-successor-to-abs/)\r\n\r\n## Prusa Firmware beta testers group\r\nOur beta testing group is running already for three months and over 450 users joined our ranks. As we promised in the beginning, we will reward the most active users, who help us to improve the firmware.\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank Wavexx and Leptun, both are valued long-term testers. We appreciate all the help provided and decided to send an Original Prusa i3 MK3S kit as a courtesy.\r\n\r\n"

This issue was caused by a new feature (still in development), which further lowers the noise made by the printer. Now, the code is fixed and power panic works as expected.\r\n\r\n### Heatbed noise at 110 V (60 Hz)\r\nThere were several reports regarding noise from the heatbed when the printer was connected to a 110 V (60 Hz) network. In the current release, the rising and falling edges of the pulse-width modulation (PWM) are adjusted to fix the unwanted noise. Previously, the PWM was falling from 30 Hz to 15 Hz and as a result, the PSU started to switch between high and low power mode, which caused the \"clicking\". Also, while printing at extremely high speeds over a USB connection, the altered PWM affected the planner, resulting in a slower print. This is now fixed as well.\r\n\r\n### Crash detection fixes\r\nThe crash detection feature can be turned off in the printer's menu, however, in the RC1 release, it stopped working for the Normal mode. Even when set to [OFF], the printer still detected the crash (issue #2094). The part responsible for crash detection was revised and fixed.\r\n\r\nIn very rare cases, prior to the printing phase, a false crash was detected and then while printing the first layer the printer skipped some longer segments of the G-code (above 30 mm). As a result, the extruder moved according to the next G-code instruction. We've adjusted the behavior of the crash detection for the first layer, which solved this issue.\r\n\r\n### Addition of the ASA material\r\nASA is newly introduced to the Original Prusa i3 printers and can be considered a true successor to ABS. Starting this release, ASA is included in the preheat menu with support in the PrusaSlicer. The ASA option is missing in the \"Load filament\" menu and will be added in the next release. Learn more about ASA in our latest article [ASA Prusament is here!](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/asa-prusament-is-here-learn-everything-about-the-successor-to-abs/)"

If you are experiencing frequent power surges, please consider waiting for the next release. Since this is a testing release we DO NOT recommend flashing this firmware to a production printer.**\r\n\r\n## A detailed description:\r\n### Steel sheet profiles\r\nMagnetic heatbed on MK3S/MK2.5S enables using multiple steel sheets for continuous printing. However, due to a different thickness of various sheets (textured vs smooth PEI), each sheet requires individual First layer calibration. Starting with this release, we are adding a feature, which will store the settings for up to 3 sheets. You can then easily switch between the sheets (profiles) and the printer will load the stored values.\r\n\r\nTo set up the individual sheet profiles, please head to the *Settings -> HW setup*. There are currently three sheet profiles available.\r\n\r\nFor each sheet you can do the following:\r\n1) *Select* - confirms the selection of the sheet, which will then become default\r\n2) *First layer calibration* - takes you through the first layer calibration process   \r\n3) *Rename* - enables you to change the name, up to seven characters\r\n4) *Reset* - sets the values back to the factory defaults\r\n\r\nAs soon as two or more profiles are configured, you will be able to quick-toggle between them in the main menu. A detailed description of the behaviour will be released with the final version of the firmware 3.8.0.\r\n\r\n### Nozzle diameter setup\r\nThis an initial release of this function. We need to finish the coding on the PrusaSlicer side in order to fully enable it. By default, all Original Prusa i3 printers are shipped with the 0.4mm nozzle. In case you change the nozzle, you can set the correct diameter in the printer's menu (see *Settings -> HW setup -> Nozzle d.*). The printer will then compare the stored value of the nozzle diameter with parametres in the G-code. If there is a mismatch, you will be informed to prevent a print failure.\r\n\r\n### Preliminary checks\r\nSimilarly to the previous feature, this one also requires an update of the PrusaSlicer. Once this is done, the printer will check multiple parameters in order to warn you about incompatible print settings. Before a print is started, the printer will compare parameters stored in the memory with the G-code. Checked values are nozzle diameter, the model of the printer and firmware version. Checks can be adjusted in *Settings -> Checks*.\r\n\r\nFor each controlled parameter, users can set three levels of warnings: \r\n*none* - check is turned off, the user won't receive any notification\r\n*warn* - a warning message will be displayed on the screen, user can continue with the print\r\n*strict* - a warning message will be displayed on the screen, the user can't continue until the issue is fixed, print is aborted\r\n\r\n### Firmware onscreen notification\r\nThe firmware onscreen notification about the availability of the new version no longer waits for the user response, which prevents the print from starting. The timeout is now set to 30 seconds, the printer then proceeds with the print.\r\n\r\n### Revised sound warnings\r\nIn the previous firmware release, there was an option to disable sound warnings completely by choosing the *[None]* option. Due to safety reasons, this release no longer offers this value. User can choose between *[Loud|Once|Silent|Assist]*, where the last value is newly introduced for visually impaired users.\r\n\r\nBy selecting the Assist sound mode, the printer enables accessibility feature and plays a different sound while scrolling through the menu and at the end of the menu.\r\n\r\n### Others\r\nPWM adjusted to reduce printer noise from heatbed and PSU.\r\n\r\n### Known issues\r\nThe power panic feature is not working properly for the MK3S printer. We are currently investigating all scenarios when the system is unable to recover the print after a power surge.\r\n\r\n## Prusa Firmware beta testers group\r\nOur beta testing group is running already for two months and over 400 users joined our ranks. As we promised in the beginning, we will reward the most active users, who help us to improve the firmware.\r\n\r\nThe first reward goes to Yuri D'Elia aka [Wavexx](https://github.com/wavexx) who is a valued long-term tester. We appreciate all the help provided and decided to send an Original Prusa i3 MK3S kit as a courtesy.\r\n"

Starting this release, the printer is protected against multiple quickly-following power panic scenarios and it should always recover.\r\n\r\n### Autonomous fan self-test\r\n\r\nIn the previous release, the user had to assist during the fan test. Now, the self-test is fully automatic. Printer spins up each fan from low to the max RPM and measures the values. Since both fans on the extruder have a different range, it is possible to detect, whether they are connected to the correct socket on the board and whether the fan is able to reach its max RPM.\r\n\r\n### Incorrect firmware flashing protection\r\n\r\nEach of our Original Prusa i3 printers requires a slightly different firmware. The system now checks whether you are flashing the correct hex file. For the future releases, if a wrong file is used, the user is warned during the reboot after the firmware is flashed. We are working on a feature in the PrusaSlicer, which will warn you before the entire process starts.\r\n\r\n### Min. temp safety trigger\r\n\r\nIn the case of min. temp scenario, the printer used to run the G-code on the background, but didn't execute any movements nor the filament loading, then displayed min. temp error. The new firmware will immediately restart the printer as soon as min. temp scenario occurs. This is a safety feature to prevent the printer from overheating as min. temp is mostly caused by damaged thermistor reading incorrect temperature values. After the restart, the user can start the print again, but please check whether the print starts correctly.\r\n\r\n### Enforced fan check\r\n\r\nPreviously during the \"fan error\" message, the user was allowed to continue printing without fixing the issue, this no longer possible. Until the error fixed by the user (e.g. removing the jammed filament from the fan), the print is paused. This is a safety feature preventing possible damage to the printer.\r\n\r\n## Others:\r\n\r\n- Filament runout delay fix\r\n- Extruder position after fan error fix\r\n- Text format correction on Live adjust Z screen\r\n- Display target temperature at PID calibration screen\r\n\r\n## Known issue for the future release:\r\n\r\n### Shifted print after a power panic\r\n\r\nDuring our internal tests, it was discovered that after multiple power panics in a row, the printer sometimes slightly shifts the print up in the Z axis (tenths of millimeters) during the recovery. Although this is a very unlikely situation in real-world conditions, we are working on a fix.\r\n\r\n## Prusa Firmware beta testers group\r\n\r\nAre you an experienced user, who wants to [join](https://prusaresearch.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=fc132da4017f47b701012d494&id=883d394844) our insider testing group? We are looking for skilled users, who are willing to help to improve the firmware. You will be given our most recent versions and provide feedback on any bugs or errors you might encounter. For the most active testers, we have prepared attractive rewards ;)"

In some cases, the Rambo board overheated. We have now reduced this frequency to 32 Hz so that both, old PSU (silver case) and new PSU (black case) are quiet enough and not overheating.\r\n\r\n### Octoprint MMU load failed fix:\r\n\r\nOn the older firmware version for MK2.5S and MK3S printers printer doesn't pause after MMU2 load error when printing from Octoprint. The new behaviour is, that when printing from Octoprint T-command failure block execution of following commands. The printer doesn't respond \"OK\" to Octoprint until T-command is successfully finished. There is blocking message \"MMU load failed\" on the status screen and each time printer knob is pushed, printer retries filament load to nozzle move.\r\nhttps://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/issues/1652\r\n\r\n### Bed preheat error fix:\r\n\r\nThis release fixes false detection of bed preheat error. Minimum temperature rise slope criterion in the time domain was relaxed.\r\n\r\n### SPI flash error is not blocking the printer anymore:\r\n\r\nMK3S & MK3 error message \"External SPI flash W25X20CL is not responding.\" is no more completely blocking printer operation. Now it is shown during splash screen and it is possible to use printer, only available language is English.\r\n\r\n### Other:\r\n- Enabled watchdog for MK2.5S & MK2.5\r\n- Translation corrections\r\n- IR-sensor self-test fail message added\r\n- Menu items text overflowing fix\r\n- Linearity correction not saved to EEPROM fix"

    "body": "This firmware for MK2/S contains important safety improvement in preheat error and also chosen features from MK3S branch.\r\n\r\n## Summary:\r\n- Preheat error improved\r\n- Improved temperature regulation\r\n- Remaining time estimation\r\n- Adjustable beeper notifications\r\n- Incomplete file check updated\r\n- G-code fixes (M27, M110, M115)\r\n\r\n## Detailed description of changes:\r\n\r\n### Preheat error improved:\r\n\r\nOn older firmware version there was a zone where preheat error was not working properly. If thermistor would be damaged during the preheating phase in a particular way (resistance of damaged thermistor would be in the range corresponding to the measured temperature > 150 °C), preheat error was not triggered.\r\nImproved preheat error now works in full range. MK2/S implementation also contains update which should prevent false bed preheat error occurrence. \r\n\r\n### Improved temperature regulation:\r\n\r\nWhen changing temperatures during the print, temperature regulation was very slow in some cases. Regulation has been improved.\r\n\r\n### Remaining time estimation:\r\n\r\nThe current firmware version is ready to display remaining time estimation and accurate progress on printer status screen. Information about remaining time will be counted by Slic3r and inserted into G-code file.  Gcode M73 is used for this. In this case, the letter 'R' is shown next to print time to indicate that it is remaining time estimation. For speed factor different than 100 %, time estimation may not be accurate, which is then indicated by the letter '?'. In case that there are no M73 G-codes in a file, printer behaves as in previous release versions, i.e. showing time from the print start. The status screen was slightly modified because of this feature. Symbol \"SD\" is now shown on printer status screen only during active SD print (i.e. not in idle state) together with progress in percentage. When printing over USB, there is a \"USB\" symbol shown together with progress in percentage.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to turn on/off estimated print time support in Slic3r by switching to expert mode and clicking on \"Supports remaining time\" check-box in Slic3r Printer Settings -> General. In future versions of Slic3r settings,\r\n\r\n### Adjustable beeper notifications:\r\nIn Prusa MK3S/MK2.5S firmware there are different levels of the acoustic signalization (since 3.4.0 firmware version). This feature has been ported to MK2/S firmware. User is able to choose between each level in the printer's menu -> Settings –> Sound. You can also change the sound settings during the print in the menu -> Tune.\r\n\r\nLevel description:\r\nLoud - printer uses acoustic signalization for a failure or if confirmation is needed\r\nOnce - this level is similar to Loud, but all beeps are played only once.\r\nSilent - most of the beeps are muted, the user is informed only in case of a serious error\r\n\r\nMute option (all beeps muted, used in MK3S/MK2.5S printers from 3.4.0 release) has been excluded for safety reasons.\r\n\r\n### Incomplete file check updated:\r\nLast firmware [3.1.0](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/releases/tag/v3.1.0) for MK2/S can falsely report that printed G-code file is incomplete. This was happening typically with G-code files generated in new Prusa Slic3r versions. This has been fixed.\r\n\r\n### G-code fixes:\r\nG-codes which are used to report printer status (M27), machine type and firmware version (M115) and to set line number (M110) when printing remotely (for example using Octoprint) have been fixed.\r\n\r\n### Other:\r\n- Translation correction\r\n- Stop print fix"

This has been fixed. \r\nImproved mesh bed levelling (3.7.0-RC1) uses shorter Z movements to reduce overall calibration time. This in some cases leads to \"Enforced Z-leveling\" occurrence (issue https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/issues/1651) triggered by higher variability in measured Z-values, which was probably caused by mechanical resonance. In current FW version, if Z-values variability is too high for certain measured point, there is a short delay and then current point measurement is repeated with longer Z-movements (the same measurement algorithm which was used on FW 3.6.0 and all older versions).\r\n\r\n### Duplicate T-code fix:\r\nFixes issue https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/issues/1660\r\n\r\n  "

This can be done in the menu \"Settings -> Mesh bed levelling\". There is also a possibility to change the number of measurements for each point from 1 (fast, but less accurate) to 5 (most accurate) and also turn on/off magnet compensation. PINDA probe Z-coordinate measurement can be influenced by heatbed magnet proximity (by approximately 80 um) and thus distort mesh bed levelling calibration. If magnet compensation is off, all 49 points are measured and used for mesh bed levelling correction. If magnet compensation is on, for chosen points (which may be affected by magnets) are counted from surrounding points. Also, the mesh bed levelling Z-measurement algorithm was slightly modified to make the whole process faster. No G-code modification is needed. Standard G80 G-code will behave according to settings which were set in \"Settings -> Mesh bed levelling\" menu. It is also possible to use G80 Nx Ry G-code, where x is a number of mesh bed levelling points in one axis (3 or 7 are valid values) and y is number of Z-measurements for each point (which are then averaged). Settings done directly in G-code has higher priority then settings which are set in the menu.\r\nI would like to thank all who were working on this feature and helped to implement it to our Prusa FW, especially @stahlfabrik, @mionut and @3d-gussner. \r\n\r\n### MMU2S fast mode:\r\nOn MK3S printers with MMU2 connected it is possible to switch MMU between fast and stealth mode. Fast mode can save about 5 seconds per filament change, which can speed up especially long prints with frequent filament changes. MMU fast mode should be considered experimental feature for now. For highest reliability we currently recommend MMU stealth mode. Switching between MMU modes can be done in the menu \"Settings -> MMU mode\". With MK2.5S MMU runs always in stealth mode.\r\n\r\n### Improved T-code load:\r\nLoad sequence was slightly modified to reduce missing layer error count.\r\n\r\n### Change filament fix:\r\nWhen changing filament (M600 G-code, menu \"Tune-> Change filament\" or filament runout) on printers with MMU2 connected, there is a possibility to re-do filament unload and load by choosing \"Filament not loaded\". This, however, didn't work properly in some scenarios and filament could remain stuck between extruder Bondtech pulley and nozzle. This has been fixed.\r\n\r\n### Improved behaviour when removing the SD card:\r\nWhen SD card is inserted SD card menu is automatically shown. When SD card is removed menu which was active when the SD card was inserted is restored.\r\n\r\n### Autoload disabled in extruder info (MK3) and sensor info (MK3S) menu:\r\nThese menus serve for checking if the filament sensor works properly. The filament can be now inserted (without triggering load function) to check if sensor state changes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
