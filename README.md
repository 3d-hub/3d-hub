**_The server for managing 3D printers with great overview_**

3DPF is an 3D printer manager and dashboard written in Vue with Typescript meant to be accessed local, remote, offline or online. The work and effort - which was fully invested into OctoFarm by the authors of 3DPF - is now boosted üöÄ for higher code quality üòé and robustness üí™. The goals are to deliver a much smoother initial setup and 100% clear user experience to ensure you can smash those printing records üñ®Ô∏è!

Note: our aim is to support all kinds of 3D Printer (FDM, resin) API's with a plugin system and documentation for extensibility. Read more about this in the roadmap section below.

## Roadmap

- [x] Vue app core and distribution setup on NPM completed
- [x] Client for basic management of OctoPrint printers (file storage, print upload and printer management)
- [x] Printer Location Map based on 2x2 groups
- [x] Server resilient against database connection failures with automatic retry of 5 seconds
- [!] Printer Group management
- [!] Full API and client test coverage >80% (now at 50%+) 
- [~] NodeJS Server legacy-free (history, alerts, custom gcode and filament)
- [ ] OctoPrint Plugin release & Filament Tracker 
- [ ] Better authentication and user management
- [ ] Raspberry Pi image and prebuilt customized OctoPi image
- [ ] First core release with documentation

There are a lot of plans in the making (f.e. tunneling, auto-discovery, plugin system,  etc.), which will be announced as we go!
