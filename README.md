**_The server for managing 3D printers with great overview_**

3DPF is an 3D printer manager and dashboard written in Vue with Typescript. The work and effort which was invested into OctoFarm by these authors of 3DPF are now boosted üöÄ for higher code quality üòé and robustness üí™. The goals are to deliver a smooth initial setup and 100% clear user experience to ensure you can smash those printing records üñ®Ô∏è!

Note: our aim is to support all kinds of 3D Printer (FDM, resin) API's with a plugin system and documentation for extensibility. Read more about this in the roadmap section below.
